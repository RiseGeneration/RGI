1
00:01:16,452 --> 00:01:18,745
Thank you very much, sir.

2
00:01:05,746 --> 00:01:07,997
You did a wonderful job. Wonderful.

3
00:01:07,998 --> 00:01:10,458
Shh. Shh.

4
00:01:10,459 --> 00:01:11,959
We did it, Pete. We did it.

5
00:01:13,962 --> 00:01:15,755
- For a moment, we had our doubts.
- Shh.

6
00:01:15,756 --> 00:01:19,258
To continue, you've listened
to a long and complex case...

7
00:01:19,259 --> 00:01:21,135
murder in the first degree.

8
00:01:21,136 --> 00:01:26,182
A premeditated murder is the most serious
charge tried in our criminal courts.

9
00:01:26,183 --> 00:01:28,017
You've listened to the testimony.

10
00:01:28,018 --> 00:01:31,020
You've had the law read to you and
interpreted as it applies in this case.

11
00:01:31,021 --> 00:01:35,124
It's now your duty to sit down and try
and separate the facts from the fancy.

12
00:01:35,942 --> 00:01:39,587
One man is dead. Another
man's life is at stake.

13
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:44,366
If there's a reasonable doubt in your
minds as to the guilt of the accused...

14
00:01:44,367 --> 00:01:46,368
a reasonable doubt...

15
00:01:46,369 --> 00:01:49,246
then you must bring me
a verdict of not guilty.

16
00:01:49,247 --> 00:01:51,207
Now if, however, there's
no reasonable doubt...

17
00:01:51,208 --> 00:01:55,185
then you must in good conscience
find the accused guilty.

18
00:01:56,213 --> 00:02:00,424
However you decide, your
verdict must be unanimous.

19
00:02:00,425 --> 00:02:03,886
In the event that you find
the accused guilty...

20
00:02:03,887 --> 00:02:07,306
the bench will not entertain
a recommendation for mercy.

21
00:02:07,307 --> 00:02:10,601
The death sentence is
mandatory in this case.

22
00:02:10,602 --> 00:02:14,413
You're faced with a grave responsibility.
Thank you, gentlemen.

23
00:02:16,316 --> 00:02:18,459
The alternate jurors are excused.

24
00:02:24,366 --> 00:02:26,467
The jury will now retire.

25
00:04:24,361 --> 00:04:26,462
Try this one.
See if I can get it...

26
00:04:27,697 --> 00:04:29,548
It's a muggy day.

27
00:04:32,702 --> 00:04:35,162
Hey. Oh, oh.

28
00:04:47,133 --> 00:04:49,301
- Piece of gum?
- No, thanks.

29
00:04:49,302 --> 00:04:51,470
This thing is...

30
00:04:51,471 --> 00:04:53,197
- Huh?
- ...move it.

31
00:04:54,724 --> 00:04:56,976
- Come on, I'll give you a hand.
- Give me a hand with that.

32
00:04:56,977 --> 00:04:58,410
That's it.

33
00:05:03,942 --> 00:05:05,651
- You know something?
- Yeah?

34
00:05:05,652 --> 00:05:07,486
I called the weather
bureau this morning.

35
00:05:07,487 --> 00:05:09,488
This is gonna be the
hottest day of the year.

36
00:05:09,489 --> 00:05:11,156
Could be.

37
00:05:11,157 --> 00:05:13,158
Boy, you'd think they'd at least
air-condition these places.

38
00:05:13,159 --> 00:05:16,578
- What is your name, sir?
- Oh, it's, uh... That one, yeah.

39
00:05:16,579 --> 00:05:18,080
Thank you very much.

40
00:05:18,081 --> 00:05:20,916
Okay, gentlemen, everybody's here.

41
00:05:20,917 --> 00:05:23,836
Now, if there's anything you want,
I'll be right outside the door.

42
00:05:23,837 --> 00:05:26,188
- Just knock.
- Okay, thanks. We will.

43
00:05:38,601 --> 00:05:39,893
Good morning.

44
00:05:39,894 --> 00:05:41,437
I never knew they locked the door.

45
00:05:41,438 --> 00:05:43,705
Sure they lock the door.
What'd you think?

46
00:05:44,691 --> 00:05:47,209
I don't know. It just
never occurred to me.

47
00:05:48,737 --> 00:05:50,612
What's that for?

48
00:05:50,613 --> 00:05:52,573
Oh, I thought we might
want to vote by ballot.

49
00:05:52,574 --> 00:05:55,325
Great idea. Maybe we can
get him elected senator.

50
00:05:57,495 --> 00:05:59,346
Just in case, you know.

51
00:06:02,751 --> 00:06:04,960
- How'd you like it?
- Oh, I don't know.

52
00:06:04,961 --> 00:06:06,712
It was pretty interesting.

53
00:06:06,713 --> 00:06:08,756
Yeah? I almost fell asleep.

54
00:06:08,757 --> 00:06:11,425
I mean, I've never
been on a jury before.

55
00:06:11,426 --> 00:06:14,236
No? I've sat on many juries.

56
00:06:15,305 --> 00:06:18,307
What gets me is the way those
lawyers talk and talk and talk...

57
00:06:18,308 --> 00:06:20,559
even when it's an open-and-shut
case like this one.

58
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,352
Did you ever hear so
much talk about nothin'?

59
00:06:22,353 --> 00:06:24,313
Well, I guess they're entitled.

60
00:06:24,314 --> 00:06:26,874
Yeah. They're entitled.
It's the system, but...

61
00:06:27,984 --> 00:06:32,154
If you ask me, I'd slap those tough kids
down before they start any trouble.

62
00:06:32,155 --> 00:06:34,323
It would save us a lot
of time and money.

63
00:06:34,324 --> 00:06:35,949
- Hey, let's get started, huh?
- That's a good idea.

64
00:06:35,950 --> 00:06:38,660
Yeah, let's get goin', huh? We
probably all got things to do here.

65
00:06:38,661 --> 00:06:40,434
I figured we'd start out
with a five-minute break.

66
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:41,789
There's one gentleman
in the bathroom.

67
00:06:41,790 --> 00:06:42,831
- Mr. Foreman.
- Huh?

68
00:06:42,832 --> 00:06:45,709
- Are, uh... Are we gonna sit in order?
- Gee, I don't know.

69
00:06:45,710 --> 00:06:47,561
I, uh... Well, I guess so.

70
00:06:52,467 --> 00:06:54,009
Uh, you're in my seat.

71
00:06:54,010 --> 00:06:56,111
- Oh. Excuse me.
- That's all right.

72
00:06:58,556 --> 00:07:00,407
Hey, that's not a bad view, huh?

73
00:07:03,937 --> 00:07:06,480
What did you think of the case?

74
00:07:06,481 --> 00:07:08,607
I mean, it had a lot
of interest for me.

75
00:07:08,608 --> 00:07:11,835
No real... dead spots.
You know what I mean?

76
00:07:12,612 --> 00:07:15,155
I tell you, we were lucky
to get a murder case.

77
00:07:15,156 --> 00:07:17,199
I figured us for an
assault or burglary.

78
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:19,535
Boy, they can be the dullest.

79
00:07:21,037 --> 00:07:22,412
Hey.

80
00:07:22,413 --> 00:07:24,081
That the Woolworth Building?

81
00:07:24,082 --> 00:07:26,083
That's right.

82
00:07:26,084 --> 00:07:27,751
Isn't that funny?

83
00:07:27,752 --> 00:07:30,212
You know, I've lived here all my life.
I've never been inside that.

84
00:07:30,213 --> 00:07:32,381
If you had to
sort out all that junk...

85
00:07:32,382 --> 00:07:34,550
Like that thing with the movies.

86
00:07:34,551 --> 00:07:37,636
Yeah. You can say that again. And what
about that business with the knife?

87
00:07:37,637 --> 00:07:40,597
I mean, asking grown-up people
to believe that kind of jazz, huh?

88
00:07:40,598 --> 00:07:43,142
Well, I expected that.
You know what we're dealing with.

89
00:07:43,143 --> 00:07:45,686
Yeah, I guess so.

90
00:07:45,687 --> 00:07:47,479
Well, your horn works.
Now try your lights.

91
00:07:49,065 --> 00:07:50,607
- What do you got, a cold?
- And how.

92
00:07:50,608 --> 00:07:52,901
These hot-weather
colds can kill you.

93
00:07:52,902 --> 00:07:55,404
I can hardly touch my nose.
You know what I mean?

94
00:07:55,405 --> 00:07:59,032
I sure do. I just got over one.

95
00:07:59,033 --> 00:08:01,306
Aw, come on. Mr. Foreman,
let's go here, huh?

96
00:08:01,332 --> 00:08:03,579
Well, that guy's still
in the bathroom.

97
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:06,498
Hey, what's new? I didn't get a
chance to see a paper this morning.

98
00:08:06,499 --> 00:08:07,666
Hmm?

99
00:08:07,667 --> 00:08:10,169
I was only wondering
how the market closed.

100
00:08:10,170 --> 00:08:12,963
You got a seat on the Exchange?

101
00:08:12,964 --> 00:08:14,798
I'm a broker.

102
00:08:14,799 --> 00:08:19,261
I run a messenger service...
the Beck and Call Company.

103
00:08:19,262 --> 00:08:21,471
The name is my wife's idea.

104
00:08:21,472 --> 00:08:25,184
Got 37 men working.
Started with nothing.

105
00:08:25,185 --> 00:08:28,437
Okay, men, let's
take our seats, huh?

106
00:08:31,524 --> 00:08:33,442
Yeah, we can all get outta
here pretty quick, huh?

107
00:08:33,443 --> 00:08:34,532
I don't know about the rest of you,

108
00:08:34,558 --> 00:08:36,737
but I happen to have tickets
to that ball game tonight.

109
00:08:36,738 --> 00:08:38,655
Yanks and Cleveland.

110
00:08:38,656 --> 00:08:40,532
Yeah, we got this kid,
Modjelewski, in there.

111
00:08:40,533 --> 00:08:42,284
Ooh, he's a real bull, this kid.

112
00:08:42,285 --> 00:08:44,494
You know... Phoom!

113
00:08:44,495 --> 00:08:46,830
A real jug handle. You know?

114
00:08:46,831 --> 00:08:49,166
Phoom!

115
00:08:49,167 --> 00:08:51,585
You're a real baseball fan,
aren't you? Huh? Yeah.

116
00:08:51,586 --> 00:08:53,128
Where do we sit here?

117
00:08:53,129 --> 00:08:56,298
Well, I thought we'd sit in order,
you know, by jury numbers.

118
00:08:56,299 --> 00:08:58,800
One, two, three, four, five...
so on, around the table.

119
00:08:58,801 --> 00:09:00,135
If that's okay with you gentlemen.

120
00:09:00,136 --> 00:09:01,303
- Sure.
- What's the difference?

121
00:09:01,304 --> 00:09:04,431
- I think it's reasonable to sit in order.
- Let it be.

122
00:09:04,432 --> 00:09:06,767
- Number 12. Do I sit down here?
- Yeah. That's 12. We go around...

123
00:09:06,768 --> 00:09:10,103
- We start with you. One, right?
- One, yeah. Two, three, four, five, six.

124
00:09:10,104 --> 00:09:12,522
What was your impression of
the prosecuting attorney?

125
00:09:12,523 --> 00:09:14,316
Okay. Two. You're two.

126
00:09:14,317 --> 00:09:15,567
I beg pardon?

127
00:09:15,568 --> 00:09:19,821
I thought he was really sharp, the way
he handled all those points one by one.

128
00:09:19,822 --> 00:09:23,033
Logical sequence.
I was very impressed.

129
00:09:23,034 --> 00:09:26,119
I think he... he did an expert job.

130
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:29,206
A lot of drive too,
you know? Real drive.

131
00:09:29,207 --> 00:09:30,941
Okay, fellas, can we
hold it down a minute?

132
00:09:30,967 --> 00:09:31,375
Sure.

133
00:09:31,376 --> 00:09:33,043
Uh, fellas.

134
00:09:33,044 --> 00:09:36,605
Say, we'd like to get started.
Gentleman at the window.

135
00:09:38,174 --> 00:09:40,425
- We'd like to get started.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

136
00:09:40,426 --> 00:09:44,179
Pretty tough to figure, isn't it? Kid
kills his father... bing, just like that.

137
00:09:44,180 --> 00:09:46,848
Aw, listen, you analyze the figures,
you'll see it happens all the time.

138
00:09:46,849 --> 00:09:48,850
They let those kids
run wild up there.

139
00:09:48,851 --> 00:09:51,645
Well, maybe it serves 'em right.
You know what I mean?

140
00:09:51,646 --> 00:09:53,313
Is... Is everyone here?

141
00:09:53,314 --> 00:09:55,232
The old man is inside.

142
00:09:55,233 --> 00:09:57,943
Oh. Would you, uh,
knock on the door for him?

143
00:09:57,944 --> 00:09:59,987
You a Yankee fan?

144
00:09:59,988 --> 00:10:01,630
No. Baltimore.

145
00:10:02,448 --> 00:10:04,049
- Baltimore?
- Yeah.

146
00:10:05,243 --> 00:10:07,869
That's like being hit in the head
with a crowbar once a day.

147
00:10:09,539 --> 00:10:10,872
Who have they got?

148
00:10:10,873 --> 00:10:13,375
No, I mean, who have they got
besides good groundskeepers?

149
00:10:13,376 --> 00:10:15,002
Say, uh, we'd like to get started.

150
00:10:15,003 --> 00:10:18,146
Oh, forgive me, gentlemen.
I... I didn't mean to keep you waiting.

151
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:20,716
Baltimore?

152
00:10:20,717 --> 00:10:23,593
Okay, gentlemen,
if I can have your attention.

153
00:10:23,594 --> 00:10:26,638
You fellas can handle this thing
any way that you want to.

154
00:10:26,639 --> 00:10:29,224
I'm, um... You know,
I'm not gonna make any rules.

155
00:10:29,225 --> 00:10:32,602
Uh, we can, well, discuss it
first and, uh, then vote on it.

156
00:10:32,603 --> 00:10:35,355
That's, of course, uh...
That's, uh, one way.

157
00:10:35,356 --> 00:10:38,400
And, uh, well, we can vote
on it right now, and...

158
00:10:38,401 --> 00:10:40,986
I think it's customary to
take a preliminary vote.

159
00:10:40,987 --> 00:10:44,656
Yeah, let's... Let's vote. Who knows?
Maybe we all can get outta here, huh?

160
00:10:44,657 --> 00:10:46,450
Uh-huh.

161
00:10:46,451 --> 00:10:49,619
Okay, then I think that, uh...

162
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:52,581
Of course you know that we have a
first-degree murder charge here...

163
00:10:52,582 --> 00:10:54,750
and if we vote the
accused guilty...

164
00:10:54,751 --> 00:10:58,086
uh, we've got to send
him to the chair.

165
00:10:58,087 --> 00:11:01,923
- Um, that's mandatory.
- I think we know that.

166
00:11:01,924 --> 00:11:03,759
- Let's see who's where.
- We might as well.

167
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:07,654
- Okay. Uh, anyone doesn't want to vote?
- All right with me.

168
00:11:08,765 --> 00:11:13,435
Okay. Then, uh, just remember that this
has to be 12 to nothing either way.

169
00:11:13,436 --> 00:11:14,978
Um, that's the law.

170
00:11:14,979 --> 00:11:17,105
Okay, are we ready?

171
00:11:17,106 --> 00:11:20,208
Now, all those voting guilty,
please raise your hands.

172
00:11:24,113 --> 00:11:27,716
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven...

173
00:11:28,951 --> 00:11:31,620
eight, nine, 10, 11.

174
00:11:31,621 --> 00:11:34,623
Okay. That's 11 guilty.

175
00:11:34,624 --> 00:11:36,224
Those voting not guilty.

176
00:11:37,293 --> 00:11:39,461
One. Right.

177
00:11:39,462 --> 00:11:41,855
That's 11 guilty. One not guilty.

178
00:11:42,673 --> 00:11:44,341
Well, now we know where we are.

179
00:11:44,342 --> 00:11:48,612
Boy, oh, boy. There's always one.

180
00:11:49,055 --> 00:11:51,431
So, what do we do now?

181
00:11:51,432 --> 00:11:53,350
Well, I guess we talk.

182
00:11:53,351 --> 00:11:54,768
Boy, oh, boy.

183
00:11:54,769 --> 00:11:56,703
You really think he's innocent?

184
00:12:00,066 --> 00:12:01,691
I don't know.

185
00:12:01,692 --> 00:12:04,653
I mean, you sat in court with the
rest of us. You heard what we did.

186
00:12:04,654 --> 00:12:06,863
The kid's a dangerous killer.
You could see it.

187
00:12:06,864 --> 00:12:08,573
He's 18 years old.

188
00:12:08,574 --> 00:12:10,742
Well, that's old enough. He...

189
00:12:10,743 --> 00:12:13,495
He stabbed his own father
four inches into the chest.

190
00:12:13,496 --> 00:12:15,831
They proved it a dozen
different ways in court.

191
00:12:15,832 --> 00:12:18,458
Would you like me to
list them for you?

192
00:12:18,459 --> 00:12:19,835
No.

193
00:12:19,836 --> 00:12:22,003
Then what do you want?

194
00:12:22,004 --> 00:12:25,006
- I just want to talk.
- What's there to talk about?

195
00:12:25,007 --> 00:12:26,425
Eleven men in here
think he's guilty.

196
00:12:26,426 --> 00:12:28,760
No one had to think about
it twice except you.

197
00:12:28,761 --> 00:12:32,055
I want to ask you something.
Do you believe his story?

198
00:12:32,056 --> 00:12:34,850
I don't know whether I believe
it or not. Maybe I don't.

199
00:12:34,851 --> 00:12:36,518
So how come you vote not guilty?

200
00:12:36,519 --> 00:12:38,520
Well, there were 11
votes for guilty.

201
00:12:38,521 --> 00:12:41,356
It's not easy to raise my hand
and send a boy off to die...

202
00:12:41,357 --> 00:12:43,525
without talking about it first.

203
00:12:43,526 --> 00:12:46,044
- Well, now, who says it's easy?
- No one.

204
00:12:47,238 --> 00:12:49,489
What, just because I voted fast?

205
00:12:49,490 --> 00:12:51,992
I honestly think the guy's guilty.

206
00:12:51,993 --> 00:12:54,870
You couldn't change my mind if
you talked for a hundred years.

207
00:12:54,871 --> 00:12:56,972
I'm not trying to change
your mind. It's just that...

208
00:12:57,457 --> 00:12:59,791
We're talking about
somebody's life here.

209
00:12:59,792 --> 00:13:01,960
We can't decide it in five minutes.
Supposing we're wrong.

210
00:13:01,961 --> 00:13:03,462
"Supposing we're wrong."

211
00:13:03,463 --> 00:13:05,547
Supposing this whole building
should fall down on my head.

212
00:13:05,548 --> 00:13:07,649
- You can suppose anything.
- That's right.

213
00:13:08,384 --> 00:13:10,218
Look, what's the difference
how long it takes?

214
00:13:10,219 --> 00:13:12,888
Suppose we do it in
five minutes. So what?

215
00:13:12,889 --> 00:13:15,098
Let's take an hour.

216
00:13:15,099 --> 00:13:17,117
The ball game doesn't
start till 8:00.

217
00:13:19,729 --> 00:13:20,996
Hmm?

218
00:13:23,065 --> 00:13:24,983
Who's got something to say?

219
00:13:24,984 --> 00:13:26,485
I'm willing to sit for an hour.

220
00:13:26,486 --> 00:13:29,279
Great. I heard a pretty
good story last night.

221
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:31,464
That's not why we're sitting here.

222
00:13:32,074 --> 00:13:35,719
All right, then you tell me.
What are we sitting here for?

223
00:13:36,871 --> 00:13:38,805
I don't know. Maybe no reason.

224
00:13:39,707 --> 00:13:43,251
Look, this kid's been kicked
around all of his life...

225
00:13:43,252 --> 00:13:47,255
you know, born in a slum,
mother dead since he was nine.

226
00:13:47,256 --> 00:13:49,549
He lived for a year and a half
in an orphanage when his...

227
00:13:49,550 --> 00:13:52,552
his father was serving a
jail term for forgery.

228
00:13:52,553 --> 00:13:54,971
It's not a very happy beginning.

229
00:13:54,972 --> 00:13:57,182
He's a... a wild, angry kid.

230
00:13:57,183 --> 00:13:58,975
That's all he's ever been.
And you know why?

231
00:13:58,976 --> 00:14:02,771
'Cause he's been hit on the head
by somebody once a day every day.

232
00:14:02,772 --> 00:14:05,065
He's had a... He's had a
pretty miserable 18 years.

233
00:14:05,066 --> 00:14:08,109
I... I just think we owe
him a few words. That's all.

234
00:14:08,110 --> 00:14:11,738
I don't mind telling you this, mister.
We don't owe him a thing.

235
00:14:11,739 --> 00:14:14,908
He got a fair trial, didn't he?
What do you think that trial cost?

236
00:14:14,909 --> 00:14:16,873
He's lucky he got it.
You know what I mean?

237
00:14:16,899 --> 00:14:20,497
- You know it.
- Now, look, we're all grown-ups in here.

238
00:14:20,498 --> 00:14:22,457
We heard the facts, didn't we?

239
00:14:22,458 --> 00:14:26,336
You're not gonna tell me that we're supposed
to believe this kid, knowing what he is.

240
00:14:26,337 --> 00:14:28,797
Listen, I've lived among
them all my life.

241
00:14:28,798 --> 00:14:32,217
You can't believe a word they say.
You know that.

242
00:14:32,218 --> 00:14:34,135
I mean, they're born liars.

243
00:14:34,136 --> 00:14:37,556
- Only an ignorant man can believe that.
- Now listen...

244
00:14:37,557 --> 00:14:40,475
Do you think you were born
with a monopoly on the truth?

245
00:14:40,476 --> 00:14:43,144
I think certain things should
be pointed out to this man.

246
00:14:43,145 --> 00:14:45,313
Come on. This isn't Sunday.
We don't need a sermon.

247
00:14:45,314 --> 00:14:47,666
Come on. We have a job
to do. Now let's do it.

248
00:14:48,609 --> 00:14:51,753
Rice Pops. It's a product
I work on at the agency.

249
00:14:52,488 --> 00:14:55,198
"The breakfast with
the built-in bounce."

250
00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:56,908
- I wrote that line.
- Very catchy.

251
00:14:56,909 --> 00:14:59,160
- Yeah.
- Say, do you mind?

252
00:14:59,161 --> 00:15:00,954
Oh, I'm sorry.

253
00:15:00,955 --> 00:15:03,498
I have this habit of doodling.
Keeps me thinking clearly.

254
00:15:03,499 --> 00:15:05,292
Yeah, we have all this work to do.

255
00:15:05,293 --> 00:15:07,085
- There's no point staying here forever.
- Sorry.

256
00:15:07,086 --> 00:15:07,919
Okay. Um...

257
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:09,379
Okay. Um...

258
00:15:09,380 --> 00:15:13,258
perhaps if the gentleman down there
who's disagreeing with us...

259
00:15:13,259 --> 00:15:16,636
Well, perhaps you could tell us why. You
know, let us know what you're thinking.

260
00:15:16,637 --> 00:15:19,097
And we might be able to show
you where you're mixed up.

261
00:15:19,098 --> 00:15:20,849
Well, look, maybe...
Maybe this is an idea.

262
00:15:20,850 --> 00:15:23,351
Now, I haven't given it much
thought, but it seems to me...

263
00:15:23,352 --> 00:15:25,706
that it's up to the
group of us to convince

264
00:15:25,732 --> 00:15:27,856
this gentleman that he's
wrong and we're right.

265
00:15:27,857 --> 00:15:30,500
Now, maybe if we each took a
couple of minutes just to...

266
00:15:31,819 --> 00:15:33,320
Well, it was just a quick idea.

267
00:15:33,321 --> 00:15:34,863
No, no, no. That's a good one.

268
00:15:34,864 --> 00:15:38,033
Uh, suppose we go once
around the table.

269
00:15:38,034 --> 00:15:40,994
- I guess you're first.
- Oh.

270
00:15:40,995 --> 00:15:42,429
Well, uh...

271
00:15:43,873 --> 00:15:46,391
Well, it-it's hard
to put into words.

272
00:15:47,335 --> 00:15:49,419
I just think he's guilty.

273
00:15:49,420 --> 00:15:52,005
I thought it was obvious
from the word "go."

274
00:15:52,006 --> 00:15:53,590
I mean, nobody proved otherwise.

275
00:15:53,591 --> 00:15:55,216
Nobody has to prove otherwise.

276
00:15:55,217 --> 00:15:57,552
The burden of proof's
on the prosecution.

277
00:15:57,553 --> 00:16:00,096
The defendant doesn't even
have to open his mouth.

278
00:16:00,097 --> 00:16:03,308
- That's in the Constitution.
- Oh, well, sure, I know that.

279
00:16:03,309 --> 00:16:05,368
Uh, what I meant was, is...

280
00:16:07,063 --> 00:16:09,147
Well, I just think he's guilty.

281
00:16:09,148 --> 00:16:10,940
I-I mean, somebody saw him do it.

282
00:16:10,941 --> 00:16:16,071
Okay. Uh, here's what I think, and I
have no personal feelings about this.

283
00:16:16,072 --> 00:16:18,339
I just want to talk about facts.

284
00:16:19,241 --> 00:16:21,468
Number one.

285
00:16:21,911 --> 00:16:26,122
The old man lived downstairs under the
room where the killing took place.

286
00:16:26,123 --> 00:16:28,333
At 10 minutes after 12:00
on the night of the killing...

287
00:16:28,334 --> 00:16:32,087
he heard loud noises,
said it sounded like a fight.

288
00:16:32,088 --> 00:16:35,048
And he heard the kid yell out,
"I'm gonna kill ya."

289
00:16:35,049 --> 00:16:37,425
A second later, he heard
a body hit the floor.

290
00:16:37,426 --> 00:16:39,219
Ran to the door, opened it up...

291
00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:41,721
saw the kid running down the
stairs and out of the house.

292
00:16:41,722 --> 00:16:43,098
Called the police.

293
00:16:43,099 --> 00:16:45,850
They came in, found the old man
with a knife in his chest.

294
00:16:45,851 --> 00:16:49,187
The coroner fixed the time
of death around midnight.

295
00:16:49,188 --> 00:16:52,357
Now these are facts.
You can't refute facts.

296
00:16:52,358 --> 00:16:54,609
The kid is guilty.

297
00:16:54,610 --> 00:16:56,695
I'm just as sentimental
as the next fella.

298
00:16:56,696 --> 00:17:00,657
I know he's only 18, but he's still
gotta pay for what he did.

299
00:17:00,658 --> 00:17:02,200
I'm with you.

300
00:17:02,201 --> 00:17:04,828
Okay. Are you finished?

301
00:17:04,829 --> 00:17:06,371
- Yeah.
- Right. Next.

302
00:17:06,372 --> 00:17:09,666
It is obvious, to me anyway,
that the boy's entire story was flimsy.

303
00:17:09,667 --> 00:17:11,960
He claimed he was at the movies
during the time of the killing...

304
00:17:11,961 --> 00:17:14,587
and yet, one hour later, he couldn't
remember the names of the films he saw...

305
00:17:14,588 --> 00:17:16,506
- or who played in them.
- That's right.

306
00:17:16,507 --> 00:17:18,883
And no one saw him going
in or out of the theater.

307
00:17:18,884 --> 00:17:20,593
Listen, what about the
woman across the street?

308
00:17:20,594 --> 00:17:22,971
If her testimony don't
prove it, nothing does.

309
00:17:22,972 --> 00:17:25,390
That's right. She was the one
who actually saw the killing.

310
00:17:25,391 --> 00:17:27,892
Now, fellas, please.
Let's go in order here, huh?

311
00:17:27,893 --> 00:17:31,229
Just a minute. Here's a woman...

312
00:17:31,230 --> 00:17:33,773
Here's a woman who was
lying in bed. She can't sleep.

313
00:17:33,774 --> 00:17:35,775
She's dying with the heat.
You know what I mean?

314
00:17:35,776 --> 00:17:37,694
Anyway, she looks out the window...

315
00:17:37,695 --> 00:17:41,364
and right across the street she sees
the kid stick the knife into his father.

316
00:17:41,365 --> 00:17:44,325
The time is 12:10 on the nose.

317
00:17:44,326 --> 00:17:48,204
Everything fits. Look, she's
known the kid all his life.

318
00:17:48,205 --> 00:17:50,415
His window is right opposite
hers across the el tracks...

319
00:17:50,416 --> 00:17:52,167
and she swore she saw him do it.

320
00:17:52,168 --> 00:17:54,369
Through the windows of
the passing el train.

321
00:17:54,395 --> 00:17:59,174
Right. This el train had no passengers
on it. It was just being moved downtown.

322
00:17:59,175 --> 00:18:02,177
The lights were out, remember?
And they proved in court that, at night...

323
00:18:02,178 --> 00:18:04,679
you can look through the windows of an
el train when the lights are out...

324
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:07,098
and see what's happening
on the other side.

325
00:18:07,099 --> 00:18:10,018
- They proved it.
- I'd like to ask you something.

326
00:18:10,019 --> 00:18:12,771
You don't believe the boy's story.
How come you believe the woman's?

327
00:18:12,772 --> 00:18:14,622
She's one of them too, isn't she?

328
00:18:17,193 --> 00:18:19,277
You're a pretty smart
fella, aren't you?

329
00:18:19,278 --> 00:18:20,779
- Okay, gentlemen.
- Now, now.

330
00:18:20,780 --> 00:18:23,072
- Now, gentlemen.
- Come on. Sit down. Sit down.

331
00:18:23,073 --> 00:18:25,700
Oh, what's he so wise about?
I'm telling you.

332
00:18:25,701 --> 00:18:29,037
Okay, now come on. Now we're
not gonna get anywhere fighting.

333
00:18:29,038 --> 00:18:30,371
Whose turn is it next?

334
00:18:30,372 --> 00:18:33,308
Oh, uh, his. Number five.

335
00:18:35,461 --> 00:18:38,313
Okay, may I... Can I pass? it...

336
00:18:39,006 --> 00:18:41,132
Well, uh, that's your privilege.

337
00:18:41,133 --> 00:18:44,344
Uh, how about the next gentleman?

338
00:18:44,345 --> 00:18:47,096
Oh. Well, uh, I don't know.

339
00:18:47,097 --> 00:18:51,409
I started to be convinced,
you know, very early in the case.

340
00:18:51,894 --> 00:18:56,105
You see, I was looking for a motive.
That's very important.

341
00:18:56,106 --> 00:19:00,401
Because if you don't have a motive,
where's your case, right?

342
00:19:00,402 --> 00:19:03,571
Anyway, that, uh, testimony
from those people...

343
00:19:03,572 --> 00:19:06,699
in the apartment across the hall
from the kid's apartment...

344
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:09,035
that was very powerful.

345
00:19:09,036 --> 00:19:11,913
Didn't they say something about a...
a fight and an argument...

346
00:19:11,914 --> 00:19:16,417
between the old man and his son
around about, uh, 7:00 that night?

347
00:19:16,418 --> 00:19:18,962
- I mean, I could be wrong, but I...
- It was 8:00.

348
00:19:18,963 --> 00:19:21,089
It was 8:00. That's right.
They heard an argument.

349
00:19:21,090 --> 00:19:22,924
They couldn't hear
what it was about.

350
00:19:22,925 --> 00:19:24,968
Then they heard the
father hit the boy twice.

351
00:19:24,969 --> 00:19:27,082
Finally they saw the boy run...

352
00:19:27,108 --> 00:19:29,681
angrily out of the house.
What does that prove?

353
00:19:29,682 --> 00:19:33,434
Well, it don't exactly prove anything.
It's just part of the picture.

354
00:19:33,435 --> 00:19:36,437
Well, you said it provided a motive. The
prosecuting attorney said the same thing.

355
00:19:36,438 --> 00:19:38,773
I don't think that was
a very strong motive.

356
00:19:38,774 --> 00:19:42,443
This boy's been hit so many times in his
life that violence is practically a...

357
00:19:42,444 --> 00:19:44,904
It's a normal state
of affairs with him.

358
00:19:44,905 --> 00:19:49,200
I just... I can't see two slaps in the face
provoking him into committing murder.

359
00:19:49,201 --> 00:19:52,887
It may have been two too many.
Everyone has a breaking point.

360
00:19:55,332 --> 00:19:57,500
Anything else?

361
00:19:57,501 --> 00:20:00,044
- No.
- Okay.

362
00:20:00,045 --> 00:20:01,896
Uh, how about you?

363
00:20:03,632 --> 00:20:05,692
I don't know. It's all been said.

364
00:20:07,136 --> 00:20:09,862
You can talk here forever.
It's still the same thing.

365
00:20:10,973 --> 00:20:14,017
This kid is five for 0.

366
00:20:14,018 --> 00:20:15,977
Well, look at his record.

367
00:20:15,978 --> 00:20:18,271
When he was 10,
he was in children's court.

368
00:20:18,272 --> 00:20:20,148
He threw a rock at a teacher.

369
00:20:20,149 --> 00:20:22,525
When he was 15,
he was in reform school.

370
00:20:22,526 --> 00:20:24,444
He stole a car.

371
00:20:24,445 --> 00:20:27,030
He's been arrested for mugging.

372
00:20:27,031 --> 00:20:29,115
He was picked up twice
for knife fighting.

373
00:20:29,116 --> 00:20:31,284
Oh, yeah, they say he's
real handy with a knife.

374
00:20:31,285 --> 00:20:34,162
Oh, this is a very fine boy.

375
00:20:34,163 --> 00:20:37,248
Ever since he was five years old,
his father beat him up regularly.

376
00:20:37,249 --> 00:20:39,751
- He used his fists.
- Well, so would I.

377
00:20:39,752 --> 00:20:41,336
A kid like that?

378
00:20:41,337 --> 00:20:44,605
It's these kids, the way
they are nowadays.

379
00:20:47,009 --> 00:20:50,278
When I was a kid,
I used to call my father "sir."

380
00:20:50,930 --> 00:20:52,305
That's right. "Sir."

381
00:20:52,306 --> 00:20:54,349
Do you ever hear a kid call
his father that any more?

382
00:20:54,350 --> 00:20:56,951
Fathers don't seem to think
it's important any more.

383
00:20:57,645 --> 00:20:59,787
- You got any kids?
- Three.

384
00:21:01,065 --> 00:21:02,498
I got one.

385
00:21:03,901 --> 00:21:05,752
Twenty-two years old.

386
00:21:11,784 --> 00:21:14,635
When he was nine years old,
he ran away from a fight.

387
00:21:16,246 --> 00:21:19,515
I saw it. I was so embarrassed
I almost threw up.

388
00:21:21,085 --> 00:21:25,813
I said, "I'm gonna make a man out of you
if I have to break you in two trying."

389
00:21:28,217 --> 00:21:30,234
Well, I made a man out of him.

390
00:21:31,136 --> 00:21:33,404
When he was 16, we had a fight.

391
00:21:34,890 --> 00:21:37,366
Hit me in the jaw.
He was a big kid.

392
00:21:40,688 --> 00:21:42,872
Haven't seen him for two years.

393
00:21:44,692 --> 00:21:47,085
Kids.

394
00:21:48,696 --> 00:21:50,755
Work your heart out.

395
00:21:53,242 --> 00:21:54,575
Well, let's get going.

396
00:21:54,576 --> 00:21:56,995
I think we're missing
the point here.

397
00:21:56,996 --> 00:22:00,498
This boy, let's say he's the product of a
broken home and a filthy neighborhood.

398
00:22:00,499 --> 00:22:04,168
We can't help that. We're here to decide
whether he's innocent or guilty...

399
00:22:04,169 --> 00:22:07,171
not to go into the reasons why
he grew up the way he did.

400
00:22:07,172 --> 00:22:09,966
He was born in a slum. Slums are
breeding grounds for criminals.

401
00:22:09,967 --> 00:22:11,926
I know it, and so do you.

402
00:22:11,927 --> 00:22:14,185
It's no secret children
from slum backgrounds

403
00:22:14,211 --> 00:22:16,423
are potential menaces to society.

404
00:22:16,724 --> 00:22:18,975
- Now I think...
- Brother, you can say that again.

405
00:22:18,976 --> 00:22:21,246
The kids who crawl out of
these places are real trash.

406
00:22:21,272 --> 00:22:24,476
- I don't want any part of them.
I'm telling you.
- Listen, mister. Listen.

407
00:22:24,502 --> 00:22:26,571
I, uh... I've lived in
a slum all my life.

408
00:22:26,597 --> 00:22:28,435
- Wait a minute.
- Please, I...

409
00:22:28,461 --> 00:22:31,237
I played in backyards that
were filled with garbage.

410
00:22:31,238 --> 00:22:33,364
I mean, maybe you can
still smell it on me.

411
00:22:33,365 --> 00:22:34,782
Now, listen, sonny.

412
00:22:34,783 --> 00:22:36,451
Come on now. There's nothing
personal about this.

413
00:22:36,452 --> 00:22:39,078
- No, there was something personal.
- Aw, come on, fella. He didn't mean you.

414
00:22:39,079 --> 00:22:41,247
Let's not be so sensitive.

415
00:22:41,248 --> 00:22:43,166
This sensitivity I can understand.

416
00:22:43,167 --> 00:22:47,895
Okay, look, let's stop the arguing.
We're only wasting time, and...

417
00:22:48,964 --> 00:22:51,190
Look, your turn down
there. Let's go.

418
00:22:52,426 --> 00:22:55,344
Oh, I didn't expect a turn. I thought
you were all gonna try to convince me.

419
00:22:55,345 --> 00:22:57,180
- Wasn't that the idea?
- Check. That was the idea.

420
00:22:57,181 --> 00:22:59,474
- Oh, I forgot about that. He's right.
- What difference does it make?

421
00:22:59,475 --> 00:23:01,893
He's the one who's keeping us in here.
Let's hear what he's got to say.

422
00:23:01,894 --> 00:23:04,687
Oh, now wait a minute. We decided
to do this a certain way.

423
00:23:04,688 --> 00:23:06,397
I think we ought to
stick to that way.

424
00:23:06,398 --> 00:23:08,483
Oh, stop being a kid, will you?

425
00:23:08,484 --> 00:23:10,568
- What do you mean "a kid"?
- What do you think I mean?

426
00:23:10,569 --> 00:23:12,295
K-I-D. Kid.

427
00:23:14,782 --> 00:23:18,534
What? Listen, just because I'm
trying to keep this thing organized?

428
00:23:18,535 --> 00:23:20,745
Here, you take it. You take
on the responsibility.

429
00:23:20,746 --> 00:23:22,705
I'll just... I'll keep my
mouth shut. That's all.

430
00:23:22,706 --> 00:23:24,791
What are you getting so hot about?
Calm down, will you?

431
00:23:24,792 --> 00:23:26,209
Don't tell me to calm down.

432
00:23:26,210 --> 00:23:28,419
Here. You wanna take the chair,
just take the chair. That's all.

433
00:23:28,420 --> 00:23:30,963
- Did you ever see such a thing?
- See if you can keep it running.

434
00:23:30,964 --> 00:23:32,219
Listen, you think it's
funny or something?

435
00:23:32,245 --> 00:23:34,675
Hey, forget it, fella. The whole
thing's unimportant. Come on.

436
00:23:34,676 --> 00:23:37,887
- Unimportant? Oh, here, you try it.
- No, nobody wants to change.

437
00:23:37,888 --> 00:23:39,722
You're doing a beautiful job.
Sit down.

438
00:23:39,723 --> 00:23:42,642
Yeah, you're doing great.
Just great, fella.

439
00:23:42,643 --> 00:23:44,619
You stay in there and
pitch. You know?

440
00:23:45,479 --> 00:23:47,788
All right. Let's hear
from somebody.

441
00:23:49,191 --> 00:23:53,361
Well, if you want me to tell you how
I feel about it, it's all right with me.

442
00:23:53,362 --> 00:23:55,571
Boy, I don't care what you do.

443
00:23:55,572 --> 00:23:58,533
All right, I don't have
anything brilliant.

444
00:23:58,534 --> 00:24:00,743
I only know as much as you do.

445
00:24:00,744 --> 00:24:04,580
According to the testimony,
the boy looks guilty. Maybe he is.

446
00:24:04,581 --> 00:24:08,851
I sat there in court for six days
listening while the evidence built up.

447
00:24:09,378 --> 00:24:11,170
Everybody sounded so
positive, you know?

448
00:24:11,171 --> 00:24:13,714
I-I began to get a peculiar
feeling about this trial.

449
00:24:13,715 --> 00:24:15,883
I mean, nothing is that positive.

450
00:24:15,884 --> 00:24:18,094
There are a lot of questions
I'd have liked to ask.

451
00:24:18,095 --> 00:24:20,888
I don't know. Maybe they wouldn't
have meant anything, but...

452
00:24:20,889 --> 00:24:22,932
I began to get the feeling
that the defense counsel...

453
00:24:22,933 --> 00:24:25,518
wasn't conducting a thorough-enough
cross-examination.

454
00:24:25,519 --> 00:24:28,980
I mean, he... he let too many
things go by, little things that...

455
00:24:28,981 --> 00:24:31,816
What little things? Listen, when
these fellas don't ask questions...

456
00:24:31,817 --> 00:24:34,402
it's because they know the answers
already and they figure they'll be hurt.

457
00:24:34,403 --> 00:24:38,406
Maybe it's also possible for a lawyer
to be just plain stupid, isn't it?

458
00:24:38,407 --> 00:24:39,782
I mean it's possible.

459
00:24:39,783 --> 00:24:41,584
You sound like you met
my brother-in-law once.

460
00:24:44,538 --> 00:24:47,348
I... I kept putting myself
in the kid's place.

461
00:24:49,084 --> 00:24:51,294
I'd have asked for
another lawyer, I think.

462
00:24:51,295 --> 00:24:53,921
I mean, if I was on
trial for my life...

463
00:24:53,922 --> 00:24:58,801
I'd want my lawyer to tear the prosecution
witnesses to shreds, or at least try to.

464
00:24:58,802 --> 00:25:02,863
Look, there was one alleged
eyewitness to this killing.

465
00:25:03,307 --> 00:25:06,767
Someone else claims he heard the killing,
saw the boy run out afterwards.

466
00:25:06,768 --> 00:25:08,978
And there was a lot of
circumstantial evidence.

467
00:25:08,979 --> 00:25:12,565
But actually, those two witnesses were
the entire case for the prosecution.

468
00:25:12,566 --> 00:25:14,442
Supposing they're wrong.

469
00:25:14,443 --> 00:25:16,319
What do you mean
supposing they're wrong?

470
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:18,279
What's the point of
having witnesses at all?

471
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:20,990
- Could they be wrong?
- What are you trying to say?

472
00:25:20,991 --> 00:25:22,617
Those people sat on
the stand under oath.

473
00:25:22,618 --> 00:25:24,243
They're only people.
People make mistakes.

474
00:25:24,244 --> 00:25:26,053
Could they be wrong?

475
00:25:26,747 --> 00:25:29,749
- Well, no, I don't think so.
- Do you know so?

476
00:25:29,750 --> 00:25:31,667
Oh, come on. Nobody can
know a thing like that.

477
00:25:31,668 --> 00:25:33,461
This isn't an exact science.

478
00:25:33,462 --> 00:25:34,895
That's right. It isn't.

479
00:25:39,968 --> 00:25:42,803
Okay, let...
Let's get to the point.

480
00:25:42,804 --> 00:25:45,473
What about the switch knife they
found in the old man's chest?

481
00:25:45,474 --> 00:25:47,975
Uh, wait-wait a minute. There's
some people who haven't talked yet.

482
00:25:47,976 --> 00:25:50,061
- Shouldn't we go in order?
- They'll get a chance to talk.

483
00:25:50,062 --> 00:25:52,480
Be quiet a second, will you?

484
00:25:52,481 --> 00:25:53,856
What about it, this...

485
00:25:53,857 --> 00:25:57,401
the knife this fine upright boy admitted
buying the night of the killing?

486
00:25:57,402 --> 00:25:58,819
Let's talk about it.

487
00:25:58,820 --> 00:26:01,155
All right, let's talk about it.
Let's get it in here and look at it.

488
00:26:01,156 --> 00:26:02,990
I'd like to see it again.
Mr. Foreman?

489
00:26:02,991 --> 00:26:06,160
We all saw what it looks like.
Why do we have to see it again?

490
00:26:06,161 --> 00:26:08,281
The gentleman has a right
to see exhibits in evidence.

491
00:26:10,332 --> 00:26:11,874
Say, could you bring us the knife?

492
00:26:11,875 --> 00:26:13,768
- Knife?
- Yeah. Thank you.

493
00:26:15,337 --> 00:26:18,673
The knife and the way it was bought is
pretty strong evidence, don't you think?

494
00:26:18,674 --> 00:26:20,424
- I do.
- Good.

495
00:26:20,425 --> 00:26:23,010
Now, suppose we take these
facts one at a time.

496
00:26:23,011 --> 00:26:26,347
One. The boy admitted going out of the
house at 8:00 on the night of the murder...

497
00:26:26,348 --> 00:26:28,349
after being slapped several
times by his father.

498
00:26:28,350 --> 00:26:31,185
No, no. No, he didn't say
"slapped." He said "punched."

499
00:26:31,186 --> 00:26:33,688
There's a difference between
a slap and a punch.

500
00:26:33,689 --> 00:26:36,357
After being hit several
times by his father.

501
00:26:36,358 --> 00:26:38,693
Two. He went directly to a
neighborhood junk shop...

502
00:26:38,694 --> 00:26:40,903
- where he bought one of those...
- Switch knives.

503
00:26:40,904 --> 00:26:42,989
Switchblade knives.

504
00:26:42,990 --> 00:26:44,865
This wasn't what you'd
call an ordinary knife.

505
00:26:44,866 --> 00:26:47,451
It had a very unusual
carved handle and blade.

506
00:26:47,452 --> 00:26:49,036
The storekeeper who
sold it to him...

507
00:26:49,037 --> 00:26:52,248
said it was the only one of its
kind he had ever had in stock.

508
00:26:52,249 --> 00:26:56,085
Three. He met some friends of his
in front of a tavern about 8:45.

509
00:26:56,086 --> 00:26:57,670
Am I right so far?

510
00:26:57,671 --> 00:26:59,880
- Yes, you are.
- You bet he is.

511
00:26:59,881 --> 00:27:03,134
He talked with his friends for about
an hour, leaving them at 9:45.

512
00:27:03,135 --> 00:27:06,178
During this time,
they saw the switch knife.

513
00:27:06,179 --> 00:27:08,055
Four.

514
00:27:08,056 --> 00:27:10,558
They identified the death
weapon in court...

515
00:27:10,559 --> 00:27:13,144
as that very same knife.

516
00:27:13,145 --> 00:27:16,022
Five. He arrived
home at about 10:00.

517
00:27:16,023 --> 00:27:18,441
Now this is where the stories
offered by the State and the boy...

518
00:27:18,442 --> 00:27:20,443
begin to diverge slightly.

519
00:27:20,444 --> 00:27:23,112
He claims that he went to
a movie at about 11:30...

520
00:27:23,113 --> 00:27:27,241
returning home at 3:10 to find his
father dead and himself arrested.

521
00:27:27,242 --> 00:27:29,368
He also claims that the two
detectives who arrested him...

522
00:27:29,369 --> 00:27:31,746
threw him down a half
a flight of stairs.

523
00:27:31,747 --> 00:27:33,664
Now, what happened
to the switch knife?

524
00:27:33,665 --> 00:27:36,375
He claims that it fell through a hole in
his pocket on the way to the movies...

525
00:27:36,376 --> 00:27:41,130
sometime between 11:30 and 3:10
and that he never saw it again.

526
00:27:41,131 --> 00:27:43,174
Now there's a tale, gentlemen.

527
00:27:43,175 --> 00:27:46,761
I think it's quite clear that the boy
never went to the movies that night.

528
00:27:46,762 --> 00:27:48,804
No one in the house saw
him go out at 11:30.

529
00:27:48,805 --> 00:27:50,389
No one at the theater
identified him.

530
00:27:50,390 --> 00:27:52,710
He couldn't even remember the
names of the pictures he saw.

531
00:27:55,562 --> 00:27:57,355
- What actually happened is this.
- Thank you.

532
00:27:57,356 --> 00:28:00,649
The boy stayed home, had another
fight with his father...

533
00:28:00,650 --> 00:28:04,445
stabbed him to death and left the
house at 10 minutes after 12:00.

534
00:28:04,446 --> 00:28:07,281
He even remembered to wipe the
knife clean of fingerprints.

535
00:28:07,282 --> 00:28:09,992
Now are you trying to tell
me that this knife...

536
00:28:09,993 --> 00:28:11,994
really fell through a hole
in the boy's pocket...

537
00:28:11,995 --> 00:28:14,455
someone picked it up off the street,
went to the boy's house...

538
00:28:14,456 --> 00:28:17,208
and stabbed his father with it
just to test its sharpness?

539
00:28:17,209 --> 00:28:19,293
No. I'm just saying it's possible
the boy lost his knife...

540
00:28:19,294 --> 00:28:21,587
and that somebody else stabbed
his father with a similar knife.

541
00:28:21,588 --> 00:28:22,880
It's just possible.

542
00:28:22,881 --> 00:28:24,565
Take a look at this knife.

543
00:28:26,385 --> 00:28:28,677
It's a very unusual knife.

544
00:28:28,678 --> 00:28:30,304
I've never seen one like it.

545
00:28:30,305 --> 00:28:33,182
Neither had the storekeeper
who sold it to the boy.

546
00:28:33,183 --> 00:28:36,227
Aren't you asking us to accept
a pretty incredible coincidence?

547
00:28:36,228 --> 00:28:38,646
I'm just saying a
coincidence is possible.

548
00:28:38,647 --> 00:28:40,247
And I say it's not possible.

549
00:28:46,780 --> 00:28:48,572
Where did that come from?

550
00:28:48,573 --> 00:28:50,032
- Where'd you get that?
- It's the same knife.

551
00:28:50,033 --> 00:28:51,617
What do you think you're doing?

552
00:28:51,618 --> 00:28:53,327
Where did you get it?

553
00:28:53,328 --> 00:28:55,663
I went out walking for a
couple of hours last night.

554
00:28:55,664 --> 00:28:57,748
I walked through the
boy's neighborhood.

555
00:28:57,749 --> 00:29:00,835
I bought that at a little pawnshop
just two blocks from the boy's house.

556
00:29:00,836 --> 00:29:02,378
It cost six dollars.

557
00:29:02,379 --> 00:29:05,589
It's against the law to buy
or sell switchblade knives.

558
00:29:05,590 --> 00:29:07,925
That's right. I broke the law.

559
00:29:07,926 --> 00:29:12,012
Listen, you pulled a real bright trick.
Now, supposing you tell me what it proves.

560
00:29:12,013 --> 00:29:14,181
Maybe there are 10
knives like that. So what?

561
00:29:14,182 --> 00:29:17,059
- Maybe there are.
- Well, what does it mean?

562
00:29:17,060 --> 00:29:20,438
You found another knife like it. What's that,
the discovery of the age or something?

563
00:29:20,439 --> 00:29:22,857
You mean you're asking us to believe
that somebody else did the stabbing...

564
00:29:22,858 --> 00:29:24,733
with exactly the
same kind of knife?

565
00:29:24,734 --> 00:29:26,068
The odds are a million-to-one.

566
00:29:26,069 --> 00:29:28,879
- It's possible.
- But not very probable.

567
00:29:29,990 --> 00:29:32,074
Okay, fellas, let's take our seats.

568
00:29:32,075 --> 00:29:34,236
There's no point in standing
around all over the place.

569
00:29:35,745 --> 00:29:39,248
You know, it's interesting that he'd find a
knife exactly like the one the boy bought.

570
00:29:39,249 --> 00:29:42,084
What's interesting about it?
"Interesting."

571
00:29:42,085 --> 00:29:44,044
Well, I don't know. I just
thought it was interesting.

572
00:29:44,045 --> 00:29:45,921
There are still 11 of us
here who think he's guilty.

573
00:29:45,922 --> 00:29:48,299
Right. What do you think
you're gonna accomplish?

574
00:29:48,300 --> 00:29:50,217
You're not gonna
change anybody's mind.

575
00:29:50,218 --> 00:29:52,678
So if you wanna be stubborn
and hang this jury, go ahead.

576
00:29:52,679 --> 00:29:55,823
The kid will be tried again and
found guilty sure as he's born.

577
00:29:57,267 --> 00:29:59,226
That's probably right.

578
00:29:59,227 --> 00:30:02,521
So what are you gonna do?
You know, we could be here all night.

579
00:30:02,522 --> 00:30:05,858
It's only one night.
A boy may die.

580
00:30:05,859 --> 00:30:08,486
Well, why don't we just
set up house here, huh?

581
00:30:08,487 --> 00:30:11,030
Someone send for Potsy the
policeman and get a pinochle deck...

582
00:30:11,031 --> 00:30:13,616
and, uh, we'll just sweat the
whole thing out right here.

583
00:30:15,035 --> 00:30:18,162
- I don't think he ought to joke about it.
- What do you want me to do about it?

584
00:30:18,163 --> 00:30:21,916
Oh, listen! I don't see what all this stuff
about the knife's got to do with anything.

585
00:30:21,917 --> 00:30:24,919
Somebody saw the kid stab his father.
What more do we need?

586
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:27,796
You guys can talk the ears right
off my head. You know what I mean?

587
00:30:27,797 --> 00:30:30,591
I got three garages of mine goin'
to pot while you're talking.

588
00:30:30,592 --> 00:30:32,343
So let's get done
and get outta here.

589
00:30:32,344 --> 00:30:35,846
The knife was very important to the
district attorney. He spent a whole day...

590
00:30:35,847 --> 00:30:38,390
He's a 15th assistant or something.
What does he know about it?

591
00:30:38,391 --> 00:30:39,934
Hey, let's hold it down.

592
00:30:39,935 --> 00:30:42,369
These side arguments
are only slowing us up.

593
00:30:45,148 --> 00:30:46,607
Well, what about it?

594
00:30:46,608 --> 00:30:48,208
You're the only one.

595
00:30:56,034 --> 00:30:58,177
I have a proposition
to make to all of you.

596
00:30:59,162 --> 00:31:01,013
I'm gonna call for another vote.

597
00:31:02,374 --> 00:31:07,670
I want you 11 men to vote
by secret written ballot.

598
00:31:07,671 --> 00:31:09,797
I'll abstain.

599
00:31:09,798 --> 00:31:12,675
If there are 11 votes for guilty,
I won't stand alone.

600
00:31:12,676 --> 00:31:16,570
We'll take in a guilty verdict
to the judge right now.

601
00:31:17,931 --> 00:31:21,742
But if anyone votes not guilty,
we stay here and talk it out.

602
00:31:24,980 --> 00:31:27,982
Well, that's it. If you
want to try it, I'm ready.

603
00:31:27,983 --> 00:31:29,525
All right.
Let's do it the hard way.

604
00:31:29,526 --> 00:31:31,527
Okay, that sounds fair.
Everyone agreed?

605
00:31:31,528 --> 00:31:33,696
- Anyone doesn't agree?
- Fine, fine. Let's go.

606
00:31:33,697 --> 00:31:34,822
Here, pass these along.

607
00:31:34,823 --> 00:31:36,674
Is that the right time?

608
00:32:08,648 --> 00:32:09,915
"Guilty."

609
00:32:12,485 --> 00:32:13,752
"Guilty."

610
00:32:15,905 --> 00:32:17,172
"Guilty."

611
00:32:19,409 --> 00:32:20,676
"Guilty."

612
00:32:22,078 --> 00:32:23,345
"Guilty."

613
00:32:25,165 --> 00:32:26,432
"Guilty."

614
00:32:28,501 --> 00:32:29,768
"Guilty."

615
00:32:30,837 --> 00:32:32,104
"Guilty."

616
00:32:33,298 --> 00:32:34,565
"Guilty."

617
00:32:38,553 --> 00:32:41,263
"Not guilty."

618
00:32:41,264 --> 00:32:42,765
"Guilty."

619
00:32:42,766 --> 00:32:44,516
Boy, how do you like that?

620
00:32:44,517 --> 00:32:47,061
Oh, and another chap
flaps his wings.

621
00:32:47,062 --> 00:32:49,897
All right, who was it?
Come on. I want to know.

622
00:32:49,898 --> 00:32:52,232
Excuse me.
This was a secret ballot.

623
00:32:52,233 --> 00:32:53,859
We all agreed on that, no?

624
00:32:53,860 --> 00:32:56,070
If the gentleman wanted
to remain secret...

625
00:32:56,071 --> 00:32:58,030
Secret? What do you mean secret?

626
00:32:58,031 --> 00:33:01,341
There are no secrets in a
jury room. I know who it was.

627
00:33:01,993 --> 00:33:03,994
Brother, you really are something.

628
00:33:03,995 --> 00:33:06,080
You sit here, vote guilty
like the rest of us...

629
00:33:06,081 --> 00:33:09,458
and then some golden-voiced preacher
starts tearin' your poor heart out...

630
00:33:09,459 --> 00:33:12,836
about some underprivileged kid just
couldn't help becomin' a murderer...

631
00:33:12,837 --> 00:33:14,421
and you change your vote.

632
00:33:14,422 --> 00:33:16,632
If that isn't the most sick...

633
00:33:16,633 --> 00:33:20,386
Why don't you drop a quarter
in his collection box?

634
00:33:20,387 --> 00:33:22,429
Oh, now just wait a minute.

635
00:33:22,430 --> 00:33:24,098
Listen, you can't talk
to me like that.

636
00:33:24,099 --> 00:33:26,016
- No. Who do you think you are?
- Calm down. Calm down.

637
00:33:26,017 --> 00:33:28,435
No. Who does he think he is?
Did you hear him?

638
00:33:28,436 --> 00:33:29,850
It doesn't matter. He's
very excitable. Sit down.

639
00:33:29,876 --> 00:33:31,780
Excitable? You bet I'm excitable!

640
00:33:31,781 --> 00:33:34,700
We're trying to put a guilty man
in the chair where he belongs!

641
00:33:34,901 --> 00:33:37,653
Someone starts telling us fairy
tales, and we're listenin'!

642
00:33:37,654 --> 00:33:39,488
Hey, uh, come on, huh?

643
00:33:39,489 --> 00:33:41,490
What made you change your vote?

644
00:33:41,491 --> 00:33:43,200
He didn't change his vote.

645
00:33:43,201 --> 00:33:44,451
I did.

646
00:33:44,452 --> 00:33:46,495
- Oh, fine.
- I knew it.

647
00:33:46,496 --> 00:33:48,539
Would you like me to tell you why?

648
00:33:48,540 --> 00:33:50,499
No, I wouldn't like
you to tell me why.

649
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:53,127
I'd like to make it clear
anyway, if you don't mind.

650
00:33:53,128 --> 00:33:54,712
Do we have to listen to this?

651
00:33:54,713 --> 00:33:56,547
The man wants to talk.

652
00:33:56,548 --> 00:33:58,215
Thank you.

653
00:33:58,216 --> 00:34:01,635
This gentleman has been
standing alone against us.

654
00:34:01,636 --> 00:34:03,971
Now, he doesn't say
the boy is not guilty.

655
00:34:03,972 --> 00:34:06,014
He just isn't sure.

656
00:34:06,015 --> 00:34:08,934
Well, it's not easy to stand alone
against the ridicule of others.

657
00:34:08,935 --> 00:34:12,146
So he gambled for support,
and I gave it to him.

658
00:34:12,147 --> 00:34:13,939
I respect his motives.

659
00:34:13,940 --> 00:34:18,569
The boy on trial is probably guilty,
but, uh, I want to hear more.

660
00:34:18,570 --> 00:34:20,446
Right now, the vote is 10 to two.

661
00:34:20,447 --> 00:34:22,781
I'm talking here! You have
no right to leave this room!

662
00:34:22,782 --> 00:34:24,742
He can't hear you. He never will.

663
00:34:24,743 --> 00:34:26,426
Let's sit down.

664
00:34:30,498 --> 00:34:32,791
Shall we continue?

665
00:34:32,792 --> 00:34:35,085
Well, I... I think we
ought to take a break.

666
00:34:35,086 --> 00:34:39,298
You know, one man's inside,
and I think we ought to wait for him.

667
00:34:39,299 --> 00:34:42,342
Okay.

668
00:34:42,343 --> 00:34:44,194
Looks like we're really
hung up here, huh?

669
00:34:45,472 --> 00:34:47,906
And that thing with the old man,
that was pretty unexpected.

670
00:34:49,893 --> 00:34:52,452
I wish I could figure out some
way we could break it up.

671
00:34:55,482 --> 00:34:59,026
You know, in advertising...
I told you I worked in an agency.

672
00:34:59,027 --> 00:35:00,110
Mm-hmm.

673
00:35:00,111 --> 00:35:02,196
Well, there's some pretty
strange people working there.

674
00:35:02,197 --> 00:35:04,364
Well, they're not strange
really, I guess.

675
00:35:04,365 --> 00:35:07,075
It's just that they have peculiar
ways of expressing themselves.

676
00:35:07,076 --> 00:35:08,410
You know what I mean.

677
00:35:08,411 --> 00:35:10,811
Of course, I suppose it's the same
in your business too, huh?

678
00:35:11,372 --> 00:35:12,956
What do you do?

679
00:35:12,957 --> 00:35:15,209
- I'm a watchmaker.
- Oh, really?

680
00:35:15,210 --> 00:35:18,504
Well, I imagine the finest watchmakers
in the world come from Europe, huh?

681
00:35:18,505 --> 00:35:21,590
Anyway, as I was telling you, in an agency,
when we reach a point like this...

682
00:35:21,591 --> 00:35:25,177
I'm telling him about, in an ad agency, when
a point like this is reached in a meeting...

683
00:35:25,178 --> 00:35:27,888
there's always some character
ready with an idea, see.

684
00:35:27,889 --> 00:35:29,932
And it kills me.

685
00:35:29,933 --> 00:35:31,517
It's the weirdest
thing in the world...

686
00:35:31,518 --> 00:35:34,937
the way they sometimes precede their
idea with a little phrase, see, like...

687
00:35:34,938 --> 00:35:37,940
Some account exec will
get up, and he'll say, uh...

688
00:35:37,941 --> 00:35:39,858
"Okay, here's an idea.

689
00:35:39,859 --> 00:35:43,570
Let's, uh, run it up the flagpole
and see if anyone salutes it."

690
00:35:43,571 --> 00:35:46,782
I mean, it's idiotic,
but it's funny, huh?

691
00:35:46,783 --> 00:35:51,386
I, uh... I got a little
excited back there. I...

692
00:35:52,288 --> 00:35:54,139
didn't mean to get nasty.

693
00:35:54,916 --> 00:35:58,810
I'm glad you're not one of those lets
these emotional appeals influence him.

694
00:35:59,879 --> 00:36:02,230
Uh...

695
00:36:15,395 --> 00:36:18,395
I don't know what's the matter with
that fan. Can't seem to get it to start.

696
00:36:24,779 --> 00:36:26,797
Eh!

697
00:36:27,824 --> 00:36:30,117
Hey, you a salesman?

698
00:36:30,118 --> 00:36:31,718
I'm an architect.

699
00:36:32,453 --> 00:36:33,871
Hmm.

700
00:36:33,872 --> 00:36:36,223
You know what the soft sell is?

701
00:36:39,043 --> 00:36:41,061
Boy, you got it. Believe me.

702
00:36:42,630 --> 00:36:44,439
I got a different technique.

703
00:36:45,133 --> 00:36:47,009
Laughs, drinks, jokes.

704
00:36:47,010 --> 00:36:49,361
Tricks. You know?

705
00:36:50,096 --> 00:36:51,405
Yeah.

706
00:36:52,765 --> 00:36:55,075
"Hit 'em where they live."
That's my motto.

707
00:36:56,394 --> 00:36:59,246
I made 27 grand last
year sellin' marmalade.

708
00:36:59,981 --> 00:37:02,582
That's not bad. I mean,
you know, considering marmalade.

709
00:37:05,695 --> 00:37:07,587
Hey, what are you gettin'
outta this... kicks?

710
00:37:09,657 --> 00:37:12,326
Or did somebody bump you on the head one
time and you haven't gotten over it?

711
00:37:12,327 --> 00:37:14,136
Maybe.

712
00:37:15,038 --> 00:37:17,664
You know, you do-gooders
are all alike.

713
00:37:17,665 --> 00:37:20,434
You're always blowing your stacks
over some guy that fanned.

714
00:37:23,421 --> 00:37:25,355
But what are you
wasting our time for?

715
00:37:26,007 --> 00:37:30,152
Why don't you donate five dollars to the
cause, and maybe it'll make you feel better.

716
00:37:33,348 --> 00:37:35,682
This kid is guilty, pal.

717
00:37:35,683 --> 00:37:38,185
It's as plain as the
nose on your face.

718
00:37:38,186 --> 00:37:40,520
So why don't we stop
wasting our time here?

719
00:37:40,521 --> 00:37:43,523
We're gonna all get sore throats
if we keep it up, you know?

720
00:37:43,524 --> 00:37:46,205
What difference does it make if you
get it here or at the ball game?

721
00:37:46,861 --> 00:37:49,863
Oh, no difference, pal.

722
00:37:49,864 --> 00:37:51,757
No difference at all.

723
00:38:03,586 --> 00:38:05,545
Nice bunch of guys, huh?

724
00:38:05,546 --> 00:38:07,923
Oh, they're about the
same as anyone else.

725
00:38:07,924 --> 00:38:10,817
Phew! Boy, what a murderous day.

726
00:38:11,719 --> 00:38:13,845
You think we'll be much longer?

727
00:38:13,846 --> 00:38:15,555
I don't know.

728
00:38:15,556 --> 00:38:17,557
Aw, he's guilty for sure.

729
00:38:17,558 --> 00:38:19,184
Not a doubt in the whole world.

730
00:38:19,185 --> 00:38:21,828
We should...
Should've been done already.

731
00:38:23,982 --> 00:38:25,315
Oh, I don't mind, you know.

732
00:38:25,316 --> 00:38:27,834
Hmm. Beats workin'.

733
00:38:31,406 --> 00:38:32,672
Uh...

734
00:38:34,951 --> 00:38:37,119
You think he's not guilty, huh?

735
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:39,054
I don't know. It's possible.

736
00:38:39,706 --> 00:38:43,583
Well, I don't know you, but I'm bettin'
you never been wronger in your life.

737
00:38:43,584 --> 00:38:46,086
You're wasting your time.
You ought to wrap it up.

738
00:38:46,087 --> 00:38:48,355
Supposing you were the
one who was on trial.

739
00:38:49,090 --> 00:38:51,049
Well, I'm not used to supposing.

740
00:38:51,050 --> 00:38:55,637
I'm just a workingman. My boss
does the supposing. But...

741
00:38:55,638 --> 00:38:57,239
Well, I'll try one.

742
00:38:58,349 --> 00:39:04,121
Supposing you talk us all out of this, and,
the kid really did knife his father. Huh?

743
00:39:12,947 --> 00:39:14,322
Are you ready?

744
00:39:14,323 --> 00:39:15,615
Hup.

745
00:39:15,616 --> 00:39:16,616
That one.

746
00:39:16,617 --> 00:39:18,385
Sorry, blue eyes.

747
00:39:19,203 --> 00:39:20,370
- Well, where else...
- Okay, fellas, let's take our seats.

748
00:39:20,371 --> 00:39:22,706
- Well, where else...
- Okay, fellas, let's take our seats.

749
00:39:22,707 --> 00:39:24,708
Looks like we'll be
here for dinner, huh?

750
00:39:24,709 --> 00:39:27,169
Okay, now let's...
Let's get down to business.

751
00:39:27,170 --> 00:39:28,628
Now, who wants to start it off?

752
00:39:28,629 --> 00:39:30,130
- I would.
- Okay, go.

753
00:39:30,131 --> 00:39:32,299
You down there.

754
00:39:32,300 --> 00:39:36,261
The old man who lived downstairs says he
heard the kid yell out, "I'm gonna kill ya."

755
00:39:36,262 --> 00:39:38,972
A second later, he heard
the body hit the floor.

756
00:39:38,973 --> 00:39:42,934
Now, he ran to the door and he saw the kid
running down the stairs and out of the house.

757
00:39:42,935 --> 00:39:44,394
What does that mean to you?

758
00:39:44,395 --> 00:39:46,048
I was wondering how
clearly the old man could

759
00:39:46,049 --> 00:39:47,856
have heard the boy's voice
through the ceiling.

760
00:39:47,857 --> 00:39:49,983
He didn't hear it through the ceiling.
The window was open.

761
00:39:49,984 --> 00:39:51,902
So was the one upstairs.
It was a hot night, remember?

762
00:39:51,903 --> 00:39:53,320
Well, it was another apartment.

763
00:39:53,321 --> 00:39:55,989
It's not that easy to identify a voice,
particularly a shouting voice.

764
00:39:55,990 --> 00:39:57,657
- He identified it in court.
- That's right.

765
00:39:57,658 --> 00:39:59,201
And don't forget the
lady across the street.

766
00:39:59,202 --> 00:40:02,079
She looked right in the open window
and saw the boy stab his father.

767
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:04,623
- Now, I mean, isn't that enough for you?
- No, it isn't.

768
00:40:04,624 --> 00:40:06,666
Boy, how do you like this guy, huh?

769
00:40:06,667 --> 00:40:08,585
It's like talking
into a dead phone.

770
00:40:08,586 --> 00:40:11,838
She said she saw the killing through
the windows of a moving elevated train.

771
00:40:11,839 --> 00:40:15,425
There were six cars on the train. She saw
the killing through the last two cars.

772
00:40:15,426 --> 00:40:17,344
She remembered the most
insignificant details.

773
00:40:17,345 --> 00:40:19,471
I don't see how you
can argue with that.

774
00:40:19,472 --> 00:40:24,117
Has anybody here any idea
how long it would take an el...

775
00:40:32,693 --> 00:40:34,361
Hey!

776
00:40:34,362 --> 00:40:35,962
This isn't a game.

777
00:40:40,159 --> 00:40:42,494
- Did you see him?
- Hey.

778
00:40:42,495 --> 00:40:44,329
- The nerve.
- All right, listen...

779
00:40:44,330 --> 00:40:47,666
- The absolute nerve.
- Forget it. It's not important.

780
00:40:47,667 --> 00:40:49,709
- "This isn't a game"?
- Calm down.

781
00:40:49,710 --> 00:40:53,130
- Who does he think he is?
- I'm telling you, forget it now.

782
00:40:53,131 --> 00:40:56,550
Has anybody any idea how long
it takes an elevated train...

783
00:40:56,551 --> 00:40:58,468
going at medium speed
to pass a given point?

784
00:40:58,469 --> 00:41:00,428
- What has that to do with anything?
- How long? Take a guess.

785
00:41:00,429 --> 00:41:03,181
- I wouldn't have the slightest idea.
- What do you think?

786
00:41:03,182 --> 00:41:05,158
I don't know. Maybe 10, 12 seconds?

787
00:41:06,060 --> 00:41:07,811
I think that's a pretty
good guess. Anyone else?

788
00:41:07,812 --> 00:41:10,689
- That sounds right to me.
- Come on. What's the guessing game for?

789
00:41:10,690 --> 00:41:12,607
- What do you say?
- Ten seconds is about right.

790
00:41:12,608 --> 00:41:14,609
All right. Say 10 seconds.
What are you getting at?

791
00:41:14,610 --> 00:41:19,739
This. It takes a six-car el train
10 seconds to pass a given point.

792
00:41:19,740 --> 00:41:22,075
Now let's say the given
point is the open window

793
00:41:22,101 --> 00:41:24,077
of the room where the
killing took place.

794
00:41:24,078 --> 00:41:27,455
You can reach out of that window
and almost touch the el tracks, right?

795
00:41:27,456 --> 00:41:29,040
Now let me ask you this.

796
00:41:29,041 --> 00:41:31,376
Has anyone here ever lived
near the el tracks?

797
00:41:31,377 --> 00:41:35,088
Well, uh, I just finished painting an
apartment that overlooked an el line.

798
00:41:35,089 --> 00:41:36,840
- I was there for three days.
- What was it like?

799
00:41:36,841 --> 00:41:38,091
- What do you mean?
- Noisy?

800
00:41:38,092 --> 00:41:40,719
Oh, brother. Don't matter though.
We were all punchy.

801
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:43,388
I lived in a second-floor
apartment near the el line once.

802
00:41:43,389 --> 00:41:46,533
When the window was open and the train
goes by, the noise is almost unbearable.

803
00:41:46,559 --> 00:41:47,685
You can hardly hear yourself think.

804
00:41:47,711 --> 00:41:49,436
All right, you can't
hear yourself think.

805
00:41:49,437 --> 00:41:51,938
- Will you get to the point?
- I will. Now just a minute.

806
00:41:51,939 --> 00:41:55,650
Let's take two pieces of testimony
and try to put them together.

807
00:41:55,651 --> 00:41:59,821
First. The old man in the
apartment downstairs.

808
00:41:59,822 --> 00:42:02,490
He says he heard the boy say
"I'm gonna kill you"...

809
00:42:02,491 --> 00:42:05,327
and a split second later
heard a body hit the floor.

810
00:42:05,328 --> 00:42:06,995
- One second later, right?
- That's right.

811
00:42:06,996 --> 00:42:13,084
Second. The woman across the street swore
positively she looked out of the window...

812
00:42:13,085 --> 00:42:16,504
and saw the killing through the last two
cars of the passing elevated train, right?

813
00:42:16,505 --> 00:42:18,924
- The last two cars.
- What are you giving us here?

814
00:42:18,925 --> 00:42:20,342
Now, just a minute.

815
00:42:20,343 --> 00:42:24,863
We've agreed that it takes 10 seconds
for a train to pass a given point.

816
00:42:25,598 --> 00:42:29,017
Since the woman saw the killing
through the last two cars...

817
00:42:29,018 --> 00:42:34,064
we can assume that the body hit the
floor just as the train went by.

818
00:42:34,065 --> 00:42:38,610
Therefore, the train had been
roaring by the old man's window...

819
00:42:38,611 --> 00:42:42,197
a full 10 seconds before
the body hit the floor.

820
00:42:42,198 --> 00:42:44,491
The old man, according
to his own testimony...

821
00:42:44,492 --> 00:42:47,494
"I'm gonna kill you," body hitting
the floor a split second later...

822
00:42:47,495 --> 00:42:50,038
would have had to hear the
boy make this statement...

823
00:42:50,039 --> 00:42:51,998
with the el roaring past his nose.

824
00:42:51,999 --> 00:42:53,625
It's not possible he
could've heard it.

825
00:42:53,626 --> 00:42:55,877
- That's idiotic. Of course he heard it.
- Do you think he could've heard it?

826
00:42:55,878 --> 00:42:58,338
He said he yelled at the top of his
voice. That's good enough for me.

827
00:42:58,339 --> 00:43:00,674
Even if he heard something, he still
couldn't have identified the voice.

828
00:43:00,675 --> 00:43:01,883
With the el roaring by?

829
00:43:01,884 --> 00:43:04,344
You're talking about a matter of seconds!
Nobody can be that accurate.

830
00:43:04,345 --> 00:43:09,057
I think testimony that could put a boy into
the electric chair should be that accurate.

831
00:43:11,185 --> 00:43:13,186
You know something? I don't
think he could've heard it.

832
00:43:13,187 --> 00:43:15,605
Maybe he didn't hear it.
I mean, with all that el noise.

833
00:43:15,606 --> 00:43:17,565
Oh, what are you
people talking about?

834
00:43:17,566 --> 00:43:19,693
Well, it stands to reason
he couldn't have heard it.

835
00:43:19,694 --> 00:43:21,695
Why should he lie?
What's he got to gain?

836
00:43:21,696 --> 00:43:23,989
Attention maybe.

837
00:43:23,990 --> 00:43:25,991
You keep coming in with
these bright sayings!

838
00:43:25,992 --> 00:43:29,119
Why don't you send 'em in to a paper?
They pay three dollars apiece.

839
00:43:29,120 --> 00:43:31,429
What are you talking
to him like that for?

840
00:43:32,290 --> 00:43:35,792
Guy talks like that to an old man really
ought to get stepped on, you know?

841
00:43:35,793 --> 00:43:37,727
You ought to have
more respect, mister.

842
00:43:38,838 --> 00:43:43,316
If you say stuff like that to him
again, I'm gonna lay you out.

843
00:43:53,185 --> 00:43:56,229
Now you go ahead. You...
You say anything you like.

844
00:43:56,230 --> 00:44:00,358
Why do you think the
old man might lie?

845
00:44:00,359 --> 00:44:03,878
It was just that I looked at
him for a very long time.

846
00:44:04,405 --> 00:44:07,741
The seams of his jacket was split,
under the shoulder.

847
00:44:07,742 --> 00:44:09,409
Or did you notice that?

848
00:44:09,410 --> 00:44:11,995
I mean, to come to court like that.

849
00:44:11,996 --> 00:44:13,763
Why...

850
00:44:14,790 --> 00:44:18,752
He was a very old man
in a torn jacket.

851
00:44:18,753 --> 00:44:21,729
And he walked very
slowly to the stand.

852
00:44:22,381 --> 00:44:26,509
He was dragging his left leg
and trying to hide it...

853
00:44:26,510 --> 00:44:28,278
because he was ashamed.

854
00:44:29,305 --> 00:44:32,824
I think I know this man
better than anyone here.

855
00:44:33,601 --> 00:44:39,105
This is a quiet, frightened,
insignificant old man who...

856
00:44:39,106 --> 00:44:41,566
who has been nothing
all his life...

857
00:44:41,567 --> 00:44:44,069
who has never had recognition...

858
00:44:44,070 --> 00:44:46,254
or his name in the newspapers.

859
00:44:46,822 --> 00:44:49,115
Nobody knows him.

860
00:44:49,116 --> 00:44:51,242
Nobody quotes him.

861
00:44:51,243 --> 00:44:55,305
Nobody seeks his
advice after 75 years.

862
00:44:56,040 --> 00:45:00,018
Gentlemen, that's a very
sad thing... to be nothing.

863
00:45:00,628 --> 00:45:05,064
A man like this needs to be
quoted, to be listened to.

864
00:45:05,591 --> 00:45:07,634
To be quoted just once.

865
00:45:07,635 --> 00:45:09,611
Very important to him.

866
00:45:10,012 --> 00:45:12,514
It would be so hard for him to
recede into the background...

867
00:45:12,515 --> 00:45:14,307
- Wait a minute.
- When there was a chance...

868
00:45:14,308 --> 00:45:17,268
What are you trying to do... tell us he'd
lie just so he could be important once?

869
00:45:17,269 --> 00:45:19,979
No. He wouldn't really lie.

870
00:45:19,980 --> 00:45:23,525
But perhaps he made himself
believe he heard those words...

871
00:45:23,526 --> 00:45:25,819
and recognized the boy's face.

872
00:45:25,820 --> 00:45:28,196
That's the most fantastic
story I've ever heard.

873
00:45:28,197 --> 00:45:31,341
How can you make up a thing like that?
What do you know about it?

874
00:45:40,292 --> 00:45:42,419
Oh, uh, does anybody
want a cough drop?

875
00:45:42,420 --> 00:45:44,754
- No, thanks.
- I'll take one.

876
00:45:44,755 --> 00:45:46,156
You can say what you like.

877
00:45:46,157 --> 00:45:48,341
I still don't see how anybody
can think he's not guilty.

878
00:45:48,342 --> 00:45:50,927
There's something else I'd like
to talk about for a minute.

879
00:45:50,928 --> 00:45:52,637
Thanks.

880
00:45:52,638 --> 00:45:56,015
I think we've proved that the old man couldn't
have heard the boy say "I'm gonna kill you."

881
00:45:56,016 --> 00:45:57,684
- But supposing...
- You didn't prove it at all.

882
00:45:57,685 --> 00:46:00,562
- What are you talking about?
- Supposing he really did hear it.

883
00:46:00,563 --> 00:46:03,064
This phrase, how many times
have all of us used it?

884
00:46:03,065 --> 00:46:04,649
Probably thousands.

885
00:46:04,650 --> 00:46:06,359
"I could kill you
for that, darling."

886
00:46:06,360 --> 00:46:08,361
"Junior, you do that once more,
and I'm gonna kill you."

887
00:46:08,362 --> 00:46:09,737
"Get in there, Rocky,
and kill him."

888
00:46:09,738 --> 00:46:11,698
We say it every day. That doesn't
mean we're really gonna kill anybody.

889
00:46:11,699 --> 00:46:13,575
Wait a minute. What are you
trying to give us here?

890
00:46:13,576 --> 00:46:17,370
The phrase was "I'm gonna kill you."
The kid yelled it at the top of his lungs.

891
00:46:17,371 --> 00:46:18,788
Don't tell me he didn't mean it.

892
00:46:18,789 --> 00:46:21,166
Anybody says a thing like that
the way he said it, they mean it.

893
00:46:21,167 --> 00:46:22,709
Well, gee, now I don't know.

894
00:46:22,710 --> 00:46:27,505
I remember I was arguing with a guy I work
next to at the bank a couple weeks ago.

895
00:46:27,506 --> 00:46:29,340
He called me an idiot,
so I yelled at him.

896
00:46:29,341 --> 00:46:32,385
Now listen! This guy's trying to make
you believe things that aren't so.

897
00:46:32,386 --> 00:46:34,554
The kid said he was gonna
kill him, and he did kill him.

898
00:46:34,555 --> 00:46:37,599
Let me ask you this. Do you really think the
boy would shout out a thing like that...

899
00:46:37,600 --> 00:46:39,476
so the whole neighborhood
could hear him?

900
00:46:39,477 --> 00:46:41,394
I don't think so.
He's much too bright for that.

901
00:46:41,395 --> 00:46:46,232
Bright? He's a common ignorant slob.
He don't even speak good English.

902
00:46:46,233 --> 00:46:49,168
"He doesn't even
speak good English."

903
00:46:51,530 --> 00:46:55,408
Mr. Foreman, I'd like to
change my vote to not guilty.

904
00:46:55,409 --> 00:46:56,910
You what?

905
00:46:56,911 --> 00:46:59,429
- You heard me.
- Are you sure?

906
00:47:00,247 --> 00:47:01,748
Yeah, I'm sure.

907
00:47:01,749 --> 00:47:04,292
The vote is nine to three,
favor of guilty.

908
00:47:04,293 --> 00:47:07,186
Well, if this isn't
the living end. Huh?

909
00:47:11,133 --> 00:47:13,985
What are you basing it on...
the stories this guy made up?

910
00:47:14,512 --> 00:47:16,930
You ought to write for one of
those kooky detective magazines.

911
00:47:16,931 --> 00:47:18,848
You'd make a fortune.

912
00:47:18,849 --> 00:47:22,368
For crying out loud. The kid's own
lawyer knew he didn't stand a chance.

913
00:47:22,770 --> 00:47:24,437
Right from the beginning,
his own lawyer knew it.

914
00:47:24,438 --> 00:47:26,314
You could see it.

915
00:47:26,315 --> 00:47:30,001
Boy, oh, boy. I'm tellin' you,
this guy here is really something.

916
00:47:30,736 --> 00:47:32,612
Look, the kid had a
lawyer, didn't he?

917
00:47:32,613 --> 00:47:35,532
He presented his case, not you.
How come you got so much to say?

918
00:47:35,533 --> 00:47:38,451
- Look, lawyers aren't infallible, you know.
- Baltimore, please. Huh?

919
00:47:38,452 --> 00:47:40,245
He was court-appointed.

920
00:47:40,246 --> 00:47:42,163
- What's that supposed to mean?
- It could mean a lot of things.

921
00:47:42,164 --> 00:47:45,500
It could mean he didn't want the case,
or he resented being appointed.

922
00:47:45,501 --> 00:47:47,418
It's the kind of case that
brings him nothing...

923
00:47:47,419 --> 00:47:50,463
no money, no glory, not even
much chance of winning.

924
00:47:50,464 --> 00:47:53,466
That's not a very promising
situation for a young lawyer.

925
00:47:53,467 --> 00:47:56,469
He'd really have to believe in his client
to put up any kind of a good case...

926
00:47:56,470 --> 00:47:58,555
and, as you pointed out a minute
ago, obviously he didn't.

927
00:47:58,556 --> 00:48:01,474
Of course he didn't. Huh.

928
00:48:01,475 --> 00:48:03,851
Who the heck could?

929
00:48:03,852 --> 00:48:06,854
Except maybe some guy's
mother or somebody. I...

930
00:48:06,855 --> 00:48:09,190
Ah, look. Will you
look at the time, huh?

931
00:48:09,191 --> 00:48:11,818
- Come on. For crying out...
- Pardon me.

932
00:48:11,819 --> 00:48:14,237
- I have made some notes here...
- Notes.

933
00:48:14,238 --> 00:48:16,948
And I would like to...
please, to say something.

934
00:48:16,949 --> 00:48:19,284
- Yeah.
- I have been listening very carefully.

935
00:48:19,285 --> 00:48:23,788
And, uh, it seems to me that this man
has some very good points to make.

936
00:48:23,789 --> 00:48:28,501
From what was presented at the trial,
the boy looks guilty on the surface.

937
00:48:28,502 --> 00:48:32,672
- But maybe if we go deeper?
- Oh, come on, will ya?

938
00:48:32,673 --> 00:48:35,049
There is a question I
would like to ask.

939
00:48:35,050 --> 00:48:38,428
Let us assume that the boy
really did commit the murder.

940
00:48:38,429 --> 00:48:41,848
Now, this happened at
10 minutes after 12:00.

941
00:48:41,849 --> 00:48:44,392
Now, how was he
caught by the police?

942
00:48:44,393 --> 00:48:48,980
He came back home,
uh, at 3:00 or so...

943
00:48:48,981 --> 00:48:52,817
and he was captured by two detectives
in the hallway of his house.

944
00:48:52,818 --> 00:48:57,488
Now, my question is, if he
really had killed his father...

945
00:48:57,489 --> 00:49:00,783
why would he come back
home three hours later?

946
00:49:00,784 --> 00:49:03,745
Wouldn't he be afraid
of being caught?

947
00:49:03,746 --> 00:49:05,580
He came home to get his knife.

948
00:49:05,581 --> 00:49:08,207
It's not nice to go around leaving
knives sticking in people's chests.

949
00:49:08,208 --> 00:49:11,044
- Yeah, especially relatives.
- Yeah.

950
00:49:11,045 --> 00:49:13,379
I don't see
anything funny about it.

951
00:49:13,380 --> 00:49:17,008
The boy knew the knife could be
identified as the one he had just bought.

952
00:49:17,009 --> 00:49:19,260
He had to get it
before the police did.

953
00:49:19,261 --> 00:49:21,542
But if he knew the knife
could be identified,

954
00:49:21,568 --> 00:49:23,848
why did he leave it there
in the first place?

955
00:49:24,266 --> 00:49:27,226
Well, I think we can assume the boy
ran out in a state of panic...

956
00:49:27,227 --> 00:49:29,687
after having just
killed his father.

957
00:49:29,688 --> 00:49:32,732
When he finally calmed down,
he realized he had left his knife there.

958
00:49:32,733 --> 00:49:35,735
Ah. This then depends on
your definition of panic.

959
00:49:35,736 --> 00:49:38,196
He would have had to be
calm enough to see to it...

960
00:49:38,197 --> 00:49:40,865
that there were no fingerprints
left on the knife.

961
00:49:40,866 --> 00:49:44,994
Now, where did this panic
start and where did it end?

962
00:49:44,995 --> 00:49:47,455
Look, you voted guilty.
What side are ya on?

963
00:49:47,456 --> 00:49:51,084
I don't believe I have to be
loyal to one side or the other.

964
00:49:51,085 --> 00:49:52,960
I'm simply asking questions.

965
00:49:52,961 --> 00:49:56,047
Well, this is just off the
top of my head, but, uh...

966
00:49:56,048 --> 00:49:58,633
well, if I were the boy and I'd
done the stabbing and everything...

967
00:49:58,634 --> 00:50:00,843
I'd take a chance and
go back for the knife.

968
00:50:00,844 --> 00:50:03,429
I'll bet he figured that nobody
had seen him running out...

969
00:50:03,430 --> 00:50:06,015
and that the body wouldn't be
discovered till the next day.

970
00:50:06,016 --> 00:50:08,142
Well, after all, it was
the middle of the night.

971
00:50:08,143 --> 00:50:10,728
I'll bet he'd figured nobody would
find the body till the next day.

972
00:50:10,729 --> 00:50:12,814
Pardon. This is my whole point.

973
00:50:12,815 --> 00:50:16,609
The woman across the street testified that
the moment after she saw the killing...

974
00:50:16,610 --> 00:50:19,278
that is, a moment after
the train went by...

975
00:50:19,279 --> 00:50:22,365
she screamed and then went
to telephone the police.

976
00:50:22,366 --> 00:50:25,827
Now, the boy certainly must
have heard the scream...

977
00:50:25,828 --> 00:50:29,414
so he knew that
somebody saw something.

978
00:50:29,415 --> 00:50:32,291
I just don't think that
he would have gone back.

979
00:50:32,292 --> 00:50:35,128
Two things. One, in his state of panic,
he may not have heard the scream.

980
00:50:35,129 --> 00:50:36,879
Perhaps it wasn't very loud.

981
00:50:36,880 --> 00:50:40,341
Two, if he did hear it, he may not
have connected it with his own act.

982
00:50:40,342 --> 00:50:43,469
Remember, he lived in a neighborhood
where screams were fairly commonplace.

983
00:50:43,470 --> 00:50:46,013
- There's your answer.
- Maybe.

984
00:50:46,014 --> 00:50:48,975
Maybe the boy did kill his father,
didn't hear the scream...

985
00:50:48,976 --> 00:50:52,770
did run out in a panic,
did calm down three hours later...

986
00:50:52,771 --> 00:50:55,481
and come back to get the knife,
risking being caught by the police.

987
00:50:55,482 --> 00:50:58,484
Maybe all of those things happened,
but maybe they didn't.

988
00:50:58,485 --> 00:51:01,320
I think there's enough doubt that we can
wonder whether he was there at all...

989
00:51:01,321 --> 00:51:03,072
during the time the
killing took place.

990
00:51:03,073 --> 00:51:04,907
What do you mean doubt?
What are you talking about?

991
00:51:04,908 --> 00:51:06,701
Didn't the old man see him
running out of the house?

992
00:51:06,702 --> 00:51:08,578
He's twisting the facts,
I'm telling you.

993
00:51:08,579 --> 00:51:11,998
Did or didn't the old man see the kid
running out of the house at 12:10?

994
00:51:11,999 --> 00:51:14,000
Well, did or didn't he?

995
00:51:14,001 --> 00:51:17,295
- He says he did.
- "Says he did"? Boy! How do you like that?

996
00:51:17,296 --> 00:51:20,339
- Now, look, witnesses can make mistakes.
- Sure, when you want them to, they do.

997
00:51:20,340 --> 00:51:22,675
Or when he wants them to, they do.
You know what I mean?

998
00:51:22,676 --> 00:51:24,594
- Keep the yelling down!
- Oh, you keep saying that.

999
00:51:24,595 --> 00:51:26,387
Maybe what we need
is a little yelling in here.

1000
00:51:26,388 --> 00:51:28,181
These guys keep going
off every which way.

1001
00:51:28,182 --> 00:51:30,183
Did hear the scream.
Didn't hear the scream.

1002
00:51:30,184 --> 00:51:33,436
What difference does it make? You people
are talking only about the little details.

1003
00:51:33,437 --> 00:51:36,022
You're forgetting the important stuff.
I mean, all of a sudden, everybody here...

1004
00:51:36,023 --> 00:51:38,483
- I want to call for another vote.
- I'm talking here!

1005
00:51:38,484 --> 00:51:42,253
There's another vote called for.
Now let's take our seats.

1006
00:51:46,033 --> 00:51:48,659
I never saw so much
time spent on nothing.

1007
00:51:48,660 --> 00:51:50,469
It only takes a second.

1008
00:51:51,455 --> 00:51:54,957
Okay. I guess the fastest way is to
find out who's voting not guilty.

1009
00:51:54,958 --> 00:51:57,810
Now, all those voting not guilty,
please raise your hands.

1010
00:51:58,962 --> 00:52:02,632
Still the same. One, two,
three not guilty. Nine guilty.

1011
00:52:02,633 --> 00:52:04,383
So, now where are we?

1012
00:52:04,384 --> 00:52:07,887
I'm telling you, we can yackety-yack until
next Tuesday. Where's it all getting us?

1013
00:52:07,888 --> 00:52:10,723
Pardon. I vote not guilty.

1014
00:52:10,724 --> 00:52:13,810
Oh!

1015
00:52:13,811 --> 00:52:17,188
What are ya talking about? I mean, we're
all going crazy in here or something.

1016
00:52:17,189 --> 00:52:21,067
The kid is guilty. Why don't
you listen to the facts?

1017
00:52:21,068 --> 00:52:23,402
Tell him, will ya? Now this
is getting to be a joke.

1018
00:52:23,403 --> 00:52:26,697
The vote is eight to four,
favor of guilty.

1019
00:52:26,698 --> 00:52:30,451
What is this, love your underprivileged
brother week or something?

1020
00:52:30,452 --> 00:52:33,037
I want you to get up and tell me
why you changed your vote.

1021
00:52:33,038 --> 00:52:37,416
- Come on. Give me your reasons.
- I don't have to defend my decision to you.

1022
00:52:37,417 --> 00:52:39,252
There is a reasonable
doubt in my mind.

1023
00:52:39,253 --> 00:52:42,338
What reasonable doubt? That's nothing
but words. Here, look at this.

1024
00:52:42,339 --> 00:52:47,343
The kid you just decided isn't guilty
was seen ramming this into his father.

1025
00:52:47,344 --> 00:52:49,428
Now, what about this,
Mr. Reasonable Doubt?

1026
00:52:49,429 --> 00:52:52,181
That's not the knife.
Don't you remember?

1027
00:52:52,182 --> 00:52:54,433
Oh, brilliant.

1028
00:52:54,434 --> 00:52:56,811
I'm telling ya,
this is the craziest.

1029
00:52:56,812 --> 00:52:59,063
I mean, what are we
supposed to believe?

1030
00:52:59,064 --> 00:53:01,983
I mean, you're sittin' here, you're pulling
stories out of thin air, you know?

1031
00:53:01,984 --> 00:53:05,778
A guy like this, if he's, uh, sitting
ringside at the Dempsey-Firpo fight...

1032
00:53:05,779 --> 00:53:08,322
he'd be trying to
tell you that, uh...

1033
00:53:08,323 --> 00:53:10,783
Look. Now, what about the old man?

1034
00:53:10,784 --> 00:53:13,452
Are we supposed to believe that he
didn't get up and run to his door...

1035
00:53:13,453 --> 00:53:16,539
and see the kid tearing down the
steps 15 seconds after the killing?

1036
00:53:16,540 --> 00:53:19,083
He's just saying so to
be important, right?

1037
00:53:19,084 --> 00:53:20,644
I mean, what's the point
of the whole thing?

1038
00:53:20,670 --> 00:53:21,961
Wait. Hold it a
second, will you?

1039
00:53:21,962 --> 00:53:24,255
Oh, and the Baltimore rooter
is heard from again now...

1040
00:53:24,256 --> 00:53:26,299
and pop-ups are fallin' for
base hits wherever we look.

1041
00:53:26,300 --> 00:53:29,635
Hold it a second. Now, look... Did
the old man say he ran to the door?

1042
00:53:29,636 --> 00:53:31,555
Ran, walked. What's the difference?
He got on, didn't he?

1043
00:53:31,581 --> 00:53:32,680
I mean, he got there, didn't he?

1044
00:53:32,681 --> 00:53:35,308
- No, now wait a second.
- He said he ran. At least I think he did.

1045
00:53:35,309 --> 00:53:38,811
Look, I don't remember what he said, but I
don't see how he could have run to the door.

1046
00:53:38,812 --> 00:53:41,272
He said he went from his
bedroom to the front door.

1047
00:53:41,273 --> 00:53:42,982
- Now, isn't that enough?
- Where was the bedroom?

1048
00:53:42,983 --> 00:53:45,318
- It was down the hall somewhere.
- I thought you remembered everything.

1049
00:53:45,319 --> 00:53:47,653
- Don't you remember that?
- No.

1050
00:53:47,654 --> 00:53:49,964
Mr. Foreman, I'd like to see
a diagram of the apartment.

1051
00:53:49,990 --> 00:53:52,558
Why don't we just have 'em run the trial all
over again so you can get everything straight?

1052
00:53:52,559 --> 00:53:53,284
Mr. Foreman.

1053
00:53:53,285 --> 00:53:55,995
How come you're the only one in this
room wants to see exhibits all the time?

1054
00:53:55,996 --> 00:53:58,789
- I want to see this one too.
- And I'd like to stop wasting time.

1055
00:53:58,790 --> 00:54:01,709
If we're gonna start wading through all that
nonsense about where the body was found...

1056
00:54:01,710 --> 00:54:03,753
We're not, not unless
somebody else wants to.

1057
00:54:03,754 --> 00:54:05,546
But I'd like to find
out if an old man...

1058
00:54:05,547 --> 00:54:08,007
who drags one foot when he walks
'cause he had a stroke last year...

1059
00:54:08,008 --> 00:54:10,509
can get from his bedroom to
his front door in 15 seconds.

1060
00:54:10,510 --> 00:54:12,261
- He said 20 seconds.
- He said 15.

1061
00:54:12,262 --> 00:54:14,513
He said 20 seconds. What are
you trying to distort...

1062
00:54:14,514 --> 00:54:17,850
- He said 15.
- How does he know how long 15 seconds is?

1063
00:54:17,851 --> 00:54:19,602
You can't judge a thing like that.

1064
00:54:19,603 --> 00:54:22,063
He said 15 seconds.
He was very positive about it.

1065
00:54:22,064 --> 00:54:24,357
He was an old man.
Half the time he was confused.

1066
00:54:24,358 --> 00:54:26,751
How could he be positive
about anything?

1067
00:54:34,326 --> 00:54:36,529
I don't see what you're
going to prove here.

1068
00:54:36,555 --> 00:54:38,537
The man said he saw
the boy running out.

1069
00:54:38,538 --> 00:54:40,790
Well, let's see if the
details bear him out.

1070
00:54:40,791 --> 00:54:43,751
As soon as the body hit the floor,
he said he heard footsteps upstairs...

1071
00:54:43,752 --> 00:54:45,503
running toward the front door...

1072
00:54:45,504 --> 00:54:48,673
heard the upstairs door open,
the footsteps start down the stairs.

1073
00:54:48,674 --> 00:54:50,883
He said he got to his own front
door as fast as he could...

1074
00:54:50,884 --> 00:54:53,052
and he swore it couldn't have
been more than 15 seconds.

1075
00:54:53,053 --> 00:54:54,804
Now, if the killer began
running immediately...

1076
00:54:54,805 --> 00:54:57,098
- Maybe he didn't.
- The old man said he did.

1077
00:54:57,099 --> 00:54:59,892
You ought to be at Atlantic City
at that hairsplitters convention.

1078
00:55:01,103 --> 00:55:03,312
Hey, why don't you stop makin'
smart remarks all the time, huh?

1079
00:55:03,313 --> 00:55:06,524
My friend, for your three dollars a day,
you have to listen to everything, you know?

1080
00:55:06,525 --> 00:55:08,317
Now that you've got that thing
in here, what about it?

1081
00:55:08,318 --> 00:55:10,569
All right. Here's the apartment
where the killing took place.

1082
00:55:10,570 --> 00:55:13,698
The old man's apartment was directly
beneath and exactly the same.

1083
00:55:13,699 --> 00:55:16,993
Here are the el tracks, the bedroom,
living room, kitchen, bathroom.

1084
00:55:16,994 --> 00:55:19,078
Here's the hall.
Here are the stairs.

1085
00:55:19,079 --> 00:55:21,414
Now, the old man was in
this bedroom right here.

1086
00:55:21,415 --> 00:55:24,166
He says he crossed to the door
and walked down the hall...

1087
00:55:24,167 --> 00:55:27,211
opened the front door just in time to
see the boy running down the stairs.

1088
00:55:27,212 --> 00:55:30,631
- Am I right so far?
- That's the story, for the 19th time.

1089
00:55:30,632 --> 00:55:34,260
- Fifteen seconds after the body hit the floor.
- Correct.

1090
00:55:34,261 --> 00:55:36,387
Now, let's see. It was...

1091
00:55:36,388 --> 00:55:40,474
It's 12 feet from the bed to
the door. The hall is 43 feet.

1092
00:55:40,475 --> 00:55:43,769
He would have had to walk 12 feet,
open the bedroom door...

1093
00:55:43,770 --> 00:55:47,481
walk 43 feet down and open the
front door all in 15 seconds.

1094
00:55:47,482 --> 00:55:50,276
- Do you think he could have done it?
- Sure he could have done it.

1095
00:55:50,277 --> 00:55:52,945
He can walk only very slowly. They had
to help him into the witness chair.

1096
00:55:52,946 --> 00:55:54,697
You make it sound like a long walk.

1097
00:55:54,698 --> 00:55:57,116
For an old man who had a
stroke, it is a long walk.

1098
00:55:57,117 --> 00:55:58,241
Oh! What are you doing?

1099
00:55:58,267 --> 00:56:00,636
I'm gonna try it,
see how long it took him.

1100
00:56:00,662 --> 00:56:02,011
What do you mean,
you want to try it?

1101
00:56:02,012 --> 00:56:04,098
Why didn't his lawyer bring
it up if it's so important?

1102
00:56:04,124 --> 00:56:05,381
Maybe he just didn't
think about it, huh?

1103
00:56:05,382 --> 00:56:07,835
What do you mean, didn't think of it?
You think the man's an idiot or something?

1104
00:56:07,836 --> 00:56:09,462
- It's an obvious thing.
- Did you think of it?

1105
00:56:09,463 --> 00:56:11,213
Listen, smart guy. Don't matter
whether I thought of it.

1106
00:56:11,214 --> 00:56:13,524
He didn't bring it up because he knew it would
hurt his case. What do you think of that?

1107
00:56:13,550 --> 00:56:15,487
Maybe he didn't bring it
up because it would have

1108
00:56:15,488 --> 00:56:17,470
meant bullying and badgering
a helpless old man.

1109
00:56:17,471 --> 00:56:20,890
You know that doesn't sit very well with
a jury. Most lawyers avoid it if they can.

1110
00:56:20,891 --> 00:56:23,684
- So, what kind of a bum is he then?
- That's what I've been asking, buddy.

1111
00:56:23,685 --> 00:56:26,812
Pass me that chair, will you?
Those two chairs are the old man's bed.

1112
00:56:26,813 --> 00:56:29,774
I just paced off 12 feet across the room.
This will be the bedroom door.

1113
00:56:29,775 --> 00:56:32,485
Oh, that's crazy. You can't
recreate a thing like that.

1114
00:56:32,486 --> 00:56:34,779
- I'd like to see it.
- The hall was 43 feet.

1115
00:56:34,780 --> 00:56:36,881
I'll pace from that
wall and back again.

1116
00:56:38,075 --> 00:56:41,994
Look, this is absolutely insane. What are
you wasting everybody's time in here for?

1117
00:56:41,995 --> 00:56:44,955
According to you, it'll only take 15
seconds. Now, we can spare that, see.

1118
00:56:48,835 --> 00:56:50,586
Come on. Knock it off.

1119
00:56:50,587 --> 00:56:52,171
Okay.

1120
00:56:52,172 --> 00:56:54,298
Okay. Okay, killer.

1121
00:56:54,299 --> 00:56:55,983
Yeah.

1122
00:56:58,220 --> 00:57:00,346
Will you stand right there
and mark the front door?

1123
00:57:00,347 --> 00:57:02,932
It was chain-locked according
to the testimony, remember?

1124
00:57:02,933 --> 00:57:04,702
Has anybody got a watch
with a second hand?

1125
00:57:04,728 --> 00:57:05,184
I have.

1126
00:57:05,185 --> 00:57:07,686
When you want me to start, stamp
your foot. That'll be the body falling.

1127
00:57:07,687 --> 00:57:09,688
You can time me from there.

1128
00:57:09,689 --> 00:57:11,857
What are we gonna do,
play charades now?

1129
00:57:11,858 --> 00:57:13,984
- Come on! What are we waiting for?
- Okay, I'm ready.

1130
00:57:13,985 --> 00:57:15,986
Well, I want to wait till
the second hand reaches 60.

1131
00:57:15,987 --> 00:57:18,005
Oh, come on.

1132
00:57:24,621 --> 00:57:27,723
Come on. Speed it up. He could
walk twice as fast as that.

1133
00:57:29,084 --> 00:57:31,644
You want me to walk
faster than that, I will.

1134
00:57:48,436 --> 00:57:50,980
Lock. Door. Stop.

1135
00:57:50,981 --> 00:57:53,065
- Right.
- What's the time?

1136
00:57:53,066 --> 00:57:56,402
Uh, exactly 41 seconds.

1137
00:57:56,403 --> 00:57:58,737
This is what I think happened.

1138
00:57:58,738 --> 00:58:01,657
The old man heard the fight between the
boy and his father a few hours earlier.

1139
00:58:01,658 --> 00:58:04,577
Then when he's lying in bed, he heard the
body hit the floor in the boy's apartment...

1140
00:58:04,578 --> 00:58:06,410
heard the woman scream
from across the street,

1141
00:58:06,436 --> 00:58:08,164
got to his front door
as fast as he could...

1142
00:58:08,165 --> 00:58:10,833
heard somebody racing down the
stairs and assumed it was the boy.

1143
00:58:10,834 --> 00:58:12,751
- I think that's possible.
- Assumed?

1144
00:58:12,752 --> 00:58:15,337
Oh.

1145
00:58:15,338 --> 00:58:18,812
Brother, I've seen all kinds
of dishonesty in my day,

1146
00:58:18,838 --> 00:58:21,385
but this little display
takes the cake.

1147
00:58:21,386 --> 00:58:23,863
You all come in here with
your hearts bleeding all

1148
00:58:23,864 --> 00:58:26,182
over the floor about
slum kids and injustice.

1149
00:58:26,183 --> 00:58:28,267
You listen to some fairy tales.

1150
00:58:28,268 --> 00:58:30,644
Suddenly you start getting through
to some of these old ladies.

1151
00:58:30,645 --> 00:58:33,689
Well, you're not getting through
to me. I've had enough.

1152
00:58:33,690 --> 00:58:35,816
What's the matter with you guys?

1153
00:58:35,817 --> 00:58:38,611
You all know he's guilty!
He's got to burn!

1154
00:58:38,612 --> 00:58:40,487
You're letting him slip
through our fingers.

1155
00:58:40,488 --> 00:58:42,781
"Slip through our fingers"?
Are you his executioner?

1156
00:58:42,782 --> 00:58:44,550
I'm one of 'em!

1157
00:58:45,619 --> 00:58:47,536
Perhaps you'd like
to pull the switch.

1158
00:58:47,537 --> 00:58:49,622
For this kid, you bet I would.

1159
00:58:49,623 --> 00:58:52,975
I feel sorry for you. What it must
feel like to want to pull the switch.

1160
00:58:53,752 --> 00:58:55,815
Ever since you walked into
this room, you've been

1161
00:58:55,816 --> 00:58:57,755
acting like a self-appointed
public avenger.

1162
00:58:57,756 --> 00:58:59,819
You want to see this
boy die because you

1163
00:58:59,845 --> 00:59:02,134
personally want it,
not because of the facts.

1164
00:59:02,135 --> 00:59:04,386
- You're a sadist.
- You...

1165
00:59:04,387 --> 00:59:08,307
Let me go!
I'll kill him. I'll kill him!

1166
00:59:08,308 --> 00:59:10,826
You don't really mean
you'll kill me, do you?

1167
00:59:18,026 --> 00:59:20,444
Is there anything wrong, gentlemen?
I heard some noise.

1168
00:59:20,445 --> 00:59:24,531
Oh, no. Everything's all right. We're just...
You know, friendly little argument. It's...

1169
00:59:24,532 --> 00:59:27,926
Um, listen, we're through with that
diagram. You can take it if you want.

1170
00:59:29,204 --> 00:59:30,971
Here you are. Thank you.

1171
00:59:36,419 --> 00:59:38,604
What are you lookin' at?

1172
00:59:59,276 --> 01:00:01,402
I suppose somebody has
to start it off again.

1173
01:00:01,403 --> 01:00:02,174
I beg pardon.

1174
01:00:02,200 --> 01:00:05,197
"I beg pardon." What
are you so polite about?

1175
01:00:05,198 --> 01:00:07,366
For the same reason you're not.

1176
01:00:07,367 --> 01:00:09,468
It's the way I was brought up.

1177
01:00:11,288 --> 01:00:13,289
This fighting...

1178
01:00:13,290 --> 01:00:15,416
That's not why we
are here, to fight.

1179
01:00:15,417 --> 01:00:17,893
We have a responsibility.

1180
01:00:18,962 --> 01:00:23,632
This, I have always thought, is a
remarkable thing about democracy...

1181
01:00:23,633 --> 01:00:25,609
that we are...

1182
01:00:26,720 --> 01:00:29,388
Uh, what is the word?

1183
01:00:29,389 --> 01:00:32,558
Notified. That we are
notified by mail...

1184
01:00:32,559 --> 01:00:36,979
to come down to this place to
decide on the guilt or innocence...

1185
01:00:36,980 --> 01:00:41,108
of a man we have never
heard of before.

1186
01:00:41,109 --> 01:00:45,754
We have nothing to gain or
lose by... by our verdict.

1187
01:00:46,573 --> 01:00:49,800
This is one of the reasons
why we are strong.

1188
01:00:50,994 --> 01:00:53,929
We should not make
it a personal thing.

1189
01:00:55,165 --> 01:00:56,932
Thank you.

1190
01:00:58,043 --> 01:01:00,419
If nobody else has an idea,
I may have a cutie here.

1191
01:01:00,420 --> 01:01:03,255
I mean, I haven't given it much thought,
but let's throw it out on the stoop...

1192
01:01:03,256 --> 01:01:04,965
and see if the cat licks it up.

1193
01:01:04,966 --> 01:01:07,384
- The cat licks it up?
- Yeah. If the boy...

1194
01:01:11,806 --> 01:01:14,016
Look how dark it's
getting out there.

1195
01:01:14,017 --> 01:01:16,577
I'll bet we're gonna
have a storm now.

1196
01:01:18,271 --> 01:01:20,831
Boy, oh, boy. It's really hot, huh?

1197
01:01:22,233 --> 01:01:25,127
Pardon me, but don't
you ever sweat?

1198
01:01:26,446 --> 01:01:28,697
No, I don't.

1199
01:01:28,698 --> 01:01:30,783
Well, listen. I, uh...

1200
01:01:30,784 --> 01:01:34,036
I was wondering if, uh, maybe...

1201
01:01:34,037 --> 01:01:36,413
maybe we should take another vote.

1202
01:01:36,414 --> 01:01:40,793
Oh, great. Maybe we can follow this one up
with a little dancing and refreshments, huh?

1203
01:01:40,794 --> 01:01:42,686
- Hmm.
- Mr. Foreman?

1204
01:01:43,380 --> 01:01:47,007
Well, that's okay with me.
Anyone doesn't want to vote?

1205
01:01:47,008 --> 01:01:50,302
- Hey, come on. Come on.
- I'm sorry.

1206
01:01:50,303 --> 01:01:53,889
I think we ought to have an open
ballot... call out our votes, you know.

1207
01:01:53,890 --> 01:01:56,183
Let's see who stands where.

1208
01:01:56,184 --> 01:01:58,785
That sounds fair to me.
Anyone object?

1209
01:02:01,439 --> 01:02:04,249
Okay. I'll call off
your jury numbers. One.

1210
01:02:05,151 --> 01:02:08,028
Oh, that's me. I vote guilty.

1211
01:02:08,029 --> 01:02:09,905
Two?

1212
01:02:09,906 --> 01:02:11,507
Not guilty.

1213
01:02:11,950 --> 01:02:14,885
- Number three?
- Guilty.

1214
01:02:15,787 --> 01:02:17,429
Number four?

1215
01:02:18,832 --> 01:02:20,707
Guilty.

1216
01:02:20,708 --> 01:02:23,560
- Number five?
- Not guilty.

1217
01:02:24,546 --> 01:02:27,940
- Number six?
- Not guilty.

1218
01:02:28,842 --> 01:02:30,592
Number seven?

1219
01:02:30,593 --> 01:02:32,386
Guilty.

1220
01:02:32,387 --> 01:02:34,513
Number eight?

1221
01:02:34,514 --> 01:02:36,281
Not guilty.

1222
01:02:37,517 --> 01:02:40,519
- Number nine?
- Not guilty.

1223
01:02:40,520 --> 01:02:42,788
- Number 10?
- Guilty.

1224
01:02:44,482 --> 01:02:46,608
Number 11?

1225
01:02:46,609 --> 01:02:48,527
Not guilty.

1226
01:02:48,528 --> 01:02:50,128
Number 12?

1227
01:02:50,947 --> 01:02:53,365
Number 12.

1228
01:02:53,366 --> 01:02:54,967
Guilty.

1229
01:03:00,790 --> 01:03:02,958
The vote is now six to six.

1230
01:03:02,959 --> 01:03:06,211
Yeah, right. And we go into
extra innings here, huh?

1231
01:03:08,548 --> 01:03:13,135
Six to six. I'm telling you, some of you
people in here must be out of your minds.

1232
01:03:13,136 --> 01:03:15,053
A kid like that.

1233
01:03:15,054 --> 01:03:18,390
I don't think the kind of boy he
is has anything to do with it.

1234
01:03:18,391 --> 01:03:20,559
The facts are supposed
to determine the case.

1235
01:03:20,560 --> 01:03:22,811
Don't give me that!
I'm sick and tired of facts!

1236
01:03:22,812 --> 01:03:24,897
You can twist them any way you like.
You know what I mean?

1237
01:03:24,898 --> 01:03:27,566
That's exactly the point this
gentleman has been making.

1238
01:03:27,567 --> 01:03:28,167
Oh!

1239
01:03:28,193 --> 01:03:30,569
I mean, you keep shouting
at the top of your lungs.

1240
01:03:32,155 --> 01:03:34,156
I'd like to be a few years younger.

1241
01:03:34,157 --> 01:03:36,174
That man gets on my...

1242
01:03:39,454 --> 01:03:42,372
- My, it's hot in here, isn't it?
- Do you want a drink of water?

1243
01:03:42,373 --> 01:03:46,168
No. No, thanks. Thanks.

1244
01:03:53,927 --> 01:03:55,802
It's gonna rain.

1245
01:03:55,803 --> 01:03:58,155
Well, how'd you figure
that out, killer?

1246
01:03:59,307 --> 01:04:01,266
How come you changed your vote?

1247
01:04:01,267 --> 01:04:03,769
Well, it just seemed to me
there was room for doubt.

1248
01:04:03,770 --> 01:04:06,063
You haven't got a leg to stand on.
You know that, I hope.

1249
01:04:06,064 --> 01:04:09,149
I don't feel that way. There were a
lot of details that never came out.

1250
01:04:09,150 --> 01:04:12,778
- Yeah. Well, good luck.
- Oh, come on. You're like everybody else.

1251
01:04:12,779 --> 01:04:15,088
You think too much.
You get mixed up.

1252
01:04:16,241 --> 01:04:17,373
You know what I mean?

1253
01:04:17,399 --> 01:04:20,285
Now, listen. I don't think
you have any right...

1254
01:04:20,286 --> 01:04:22,955
Loudmouth.

1255
01:05:15,592 --> 01:05:18,193
Look at that come down, will you?

1256
01:05:19,262 --> 01:05:21,221
You know...

1257
01:05:21,222 --> 01:05:23,807
this reminds me of a
storm we had last...

1258
01:05:23,808 --> 01:05:27,352
Oh, when was that? November...

1259
01:05:27,353 --> 01:05:30,522
I don't know. Something. It was
quite a storm we had there.

1260
01:05:30,523 --> 01:05:32,983
It was right in the
middle of a game.

1261
01:05:32,984 --> 01:05:35,694
Uh, we were behind 7-6...

1262
01:05:35,695 --> 01:05:38,363
but we just started to move the
ball, right off the tackle.

1263
01:05:38,364 --> 01:05:41,241
Started cutting right...
slash here and slash right in...

1264
01:05:41,242 --> 01:05:43,118
cut right through.

1265
01:05:43,119 --> 01:05:45,704
And, uh...

1266
01:05:45,705 --> 01:05:48,014
We had this kid Slattery, you know?

1267
01:05:49,083 --> 01:05:52,544
A real... He was an ox.
You know, a real ox.

1268
01:05:52,545 --> 01:05:55,130
I wish I had another
one just like him.

1269
01:05:55,131 --> 01:05:59,718
I forgot to tell you. I'm the assistant head
coach at the Andrew J. McCorkle High School.

1270
01:05:59,719 --> 01:06:01,887
- Oh, yeah?
- That's out in Queens.

1271
01:06:01,888 --> 01:06:04,723
And, uh, anyway...

1272
01:06:04,724 --> 01:06:06,892
we're starting to
move along real nice.

1273
01:06:06,893 --> 01:06:10,162
Their whole line is just...
they're just coming apart.

1274
01:06:11,356 --> 01:06:15,192
And it starts to come down
cats and dogs, just like this.

1275
01:06:15,193 --> 01:06:17,919
Just whoosh...
you know, right down.

1276
01:06:19,113 --> 01:06:22,574
Well, that was murder, you know?

1277
01:06:22,575 --> 01:06:25,243
I swear, I... I nearly bawled.

1278
01:06:25,244 --> 01:06:27,679
You just...
You couldn't go nowhere.

1279
01:06:28,831 --> 01:06:30,265
Well.

1280
01:06:45,807 --> 01:06:48,408
Hey, what is it with this fan here?
How come...

1281
01:06:56,067 --> 01:06:57,901
Hey! Huh?

1282
01:06:57,902 --> 01:07:01,296
Must have been on the
same switch with the lights.

1283
01:07:02,198 --> 01:07:05,467
Well, things are
looking up here, huh?

1284
01:07:06,035 --> 01:07:07,636
Yeah, huh?

1285
01:07:12,375 --> 01:07:14,476
Boy. That's better.

1286
01:07:21,050 --> 01:07:22,634
Hey!

1287
01:07:22,635 --> 01:07:24,402
Two points.

1288
01:07:28,307 --> 01:07:30,408
Any of you guys ever
go to the Garden?

1289
01:07:32,603 --> 01:07:35,564
That's a damn stupid thing to do.

1290
01:07:35,565 --> 01:07:37,833
Oh, I'm sorry. I, uh...

1291
01:07:38,776 --> 01:07:40,252
You know?

1292
01:07:41,863 --> 01:07:43,463
Pardon me.

1293
01:07:44,449 --> 01:07:46,867
Well, how do you like it?
Even Steven.

1294
01:07:46,868 --> 01:07:49,327
Pretty surprising, isn't it?

1295
01:07:49,328 --> 01:07:50,929
Yes.

1296
01:07:52,623 --> 01:07:56,209
Say, that business before, when
that tall guy... what's-his-name...

1297
01:07:56,210 --> 01:07:59,004
was trying to bait me...
That doesn't prove anything.

1298
01:07:59,005 --> 01:08:01,673
I'm a pretty excitable person.

1299
01:08:01,674 --> 01:08:05,594
I mean, where does he come off calling me
a public avenger, sadist and everything?

1300
01:08:05,595 --> 01:08:09,181
Anyone in his right mind
would blow his stack, huh?

1301
01:08:09,182 --> 01:08:11,558
He was just trying to bait me.

1302
01:08:11,559 --> 01:08:13,660
He did an excellent job.

1303
01:08:16,355 --> 01:08:18,648
I'll tell you what I think.
We're going nowhere here.

1304
01:08:18,649 --> 01:08:21,276
I'm ready to walk into court right
now and declare a hung jury.

1305
01:08:21,277 --> 01:08:23,195
There's no point in this
thing going on any more.

1306
01:08:23,196 --> 01:08:24,613
Yeah. I go for that too.

1307
01:08:24,614 --> 01:08:27,532
Listen, let's take it in to the judge and let
the kid take his chances with 12 other guys.

1308
01:08:27,533 --> 01:08:30,452
I don't think the judge will accept a hung
jury. We haven't been in here very long.

1309
01:08:30,453 --> 01:08:32,204
Well, let's find out.

1310
01:08:32,205 --> 01:08:33,997
I'm not in favor of that.

1311
01:08:33,998 --> 01:08:37,292
Listen. This kid wouldn't stand a chance
with another jury, and you know it.

1312
01:08:37,293 --> 01:08:40,212
Come on! We're hung. Nobody's gonna
change his vote. Let's take it inside.

1313
01:08:40,213 --> 01:08:42,506
You still don't think there's
room for reasonable doubt?

1314
01:08:42,507 --> 01:08:43,882
No, I don't.

1315
01:08:43,883 --> 01:08:45,258
Pardon.

1316
01:08:45,259 --> 01:08:48,595
Maybe you don't fully understand
the term "reasonable doubt."

1317
01:08:48,596 --> 01:08:51,239
What do you mean
I don't understand?

1318
01:08:52,225 --> 01:08:54,267
Boy, how do ya like this guy?

1319
01:08:54,268 --> 01:08:56,019
I'm tellin' ya, they're all alike.

1320
01:08:56,020 --> 01:08:58,939
They come over here, running for their life,
and before they can take a deep breath...

1321
01:08:58,940 --> 01:09:01,399
they're telling us how
to run the show, huh?

1322
01:09:01,400 --> 01:09:03,276
Boy, the arrogance of this guy.

1323
01:09:03,277 --> 01:09:07,948
Hey, all right. Let's stop the
arguing for about two minutes in here.

1324
01:09:07,949 --> 01:09:10,408
Now, who's got something
constructive to say?

1325
01:09:10,409 --> 01:09:14,037
I'd like to go over something,
if you gentlemen don't mind.

1326
01:09:14,038 --> 01:09:16,790
An important point for the
prosecution was the fact...

1327
01:09:16,791 --> 01:09:19,626
that after the boy claimed
he'd been at the movies...

1328
01:09:19,627 --> 01:09:21,711
during the hours that the
killing took place...

1329
01:09:21,712 --> 01:09:25,674
couldn't remember the names of the movies
or the stars who appeared in them.

1330
01:09:25,675 --> 01:09:28,260
This gentleman here has put up
that point in here several times.

1331
01:09:28,261 --> 01:09:29,803
That's correct.

1332
01:09:29,804 --> 01:09:31,763
It was the only alibi
the boy offered...

1333
01:09:31,764 --> 01:09:34,349
and he himself couldn't back
it up with any details at all.

1334
01:09:34,350 --> 01:09:37,686
Putting yourself in the boy's place,
do you think you could remember details...

1335
01:09:37,687 --> 01:09:41,231
after an upsetting experience such as
being slapped in the face by your father?

1336
01:09:41,232 --> 01:09:44,526
I think so, if there were any
special details to remember.

1337
01:09:44,527 --> 01:09:46,231
The boy couldn't remember
the names of the movies

1338
01:09:46,232 --> 01:09:47,779
he saw because be wasn't
there that night.

1339
01:09:47,780 --> 01:09:49,906
According to the police
testimony in court...

1340
01:09:49,907 --> 01:09:53,118
the boy was questioned by the detectives
in the kitchen of his apartment...

1341
01:09:53,119 --> 01:09:56,121
while the body of his father was
lying on the floor in the bedroom.

1342
01:09:56,122 --> 01:09:58,790
Do you think you could remember
details under those circumstances?

1343
01:09:58,791 --> 01:10:00,876
- I do.
- Under great emotional stress?

1344
01:10:00,877 --> 01:10:03,461
- Under great emotional stress.
- He remembered them correctly in court.

1345
01:10:03,462 --> 01:10:05,505
He named the pictures and the
stars who played in them.

1346
01:10:05,506 --> 01:10:08,758
Yes. His lawyer took great
pains to bring that out.

1347
01:10:08,759 --> 01:10:11,386
He had three months from the night
of the murder to the day of the trial...

1348
01:10:11,387 --> 01:10:13,096
in which to memorize them.

1349
01:10:13,097 --> 01:10:15,849
It's not difficult for a lawyer to find out
what played at a particular theater...

1350
01:10:15,850 --> 01:10:17,601
on a particular night.

1351
01:10:17,602 --> 01:10:19,417
I'll take the testimony
of the policemen who

1352
01:10:19,443 --> 01:10:21,313
interrogated the boy right
after the murder...

1353
01:10:21,314 --> 01:10:23,815
when he couldn't remember
a thing about the movies...

1354
01:10:23,816 --> 01:10:25,817
great emotional stress or not.

1355
01:10:25,818 --> 01:10:29,195
- I'd like to ask you a personal question.
- Go ahead.

1356
01:10:29,196 --> 01:10:32,532
- Where were you last night?
- I was home.

1357
01:10:32,533 --> 01:10:35,160
- How about the night before that?
- Come on! What is this?

1358
01:10:35,161 --> 01:10:36,578
No, it's all right.

1359
01:10:36,579 --> 01:10:39,205
I left the office at 8:30 and
went straight home and to bed.

1360
01:10:39,206 --> 01:10:40,957
And the night before that?

1361
01:10:40,958 --> 01:10:43,460
That was, uh, Tuesday night?

1362
01:10:43,461 --> 01:10:45,545
The night of the bridge tournament.
I played bridge.

1363
01:10:45,546 --> 01:10:46,963
Monday night?

1364
01:10:46,964 --> 01:10:50,275
When you get down to New
Year's Eve, 1954, let me know, huh?

1365
01:10:52,178 --> 01:10:54,237
Monday night?

1366
01:10:55,389 --> 01:10:58,475
Monday night, uh, my wife
and I went to the movies.

1367
01:10:58,476 --> 01:11:00,185
- What did you see?
- The Scarlet Circle.

1368
01:11:00,186 --> 01:11:03,521
- It was a clever whodunit.
- What was the second feature?

1369
01:11:03,522 --> 01:11:06,232
The, um...

1370
01:11:06,233 --> 01:11:08,985
I'll tell you in a minute.
The, uh...

1371
01:11:08,986 --> 01:11:13,239
Remarkable Mrs., uh, something...

1372
01:11:13,240 --> 01:11:15,784
The...

1373
01:11:15,785 --> 01:11:18,536
Mrs. Bainbridge.
The Remarkable Mrs. Bainbridge.

1374
01:11:18,537 --> 01:11:21,389
I saw that. It's called
The Amazing Mrs. Bainbridge.

1375
01:11:22,583 --> 01:11:25,043
Uh, yes. The Amazing Mrs. Bainbridge.
I think that's right.

1376
01:11:25,044 --> 01:11:27,629
Who was in The Amazing
Mrs. Bainbridge?

1377
01:11:27,630 --> 01:11:31,383
Barbara... Long, I think it was.

1378
01:11:31,384 --> 01:11:33,485
A dark, very pretty girl.

1379
01:11:34,720 --> 01:11:37,305
Ling or Long...
something like that.

1380
01:11:37,306 --> 01:11:40,600
- Who else?
- I'd never heard of them before.

1381
01:11:40,601 --> 01:11:45,105
It was a very inexpensive second
feature with, uh, unknown...

1382
01:11:45,106 --> 01:11:48,333
And you weren't under an
emotional stress, were you?

1383
01:11:51,153 --> 01:11:53,363
No.

1384
01:11:53,364 --> 01:11:55,131
I wasn't.

1385
01:11:56,909 --> 01:11:58,743
I think the point is made.

1386
01:11:58,744 --> 01:12:01,579
Big point!

1387
01:12:01,580 --> 01:12:03,832
You can talk till your tongue
is draggin' on the floor.

1388
01:12:03,833 --> 01:12:08,003
The boy is guilty, period.
You know what I mean, my friend?

1389
01:12:08,004 --> 01:12:11,356
- Who's got those cough drops?
- They're all gone, my friend.

1390
01:12:13,259 --> 01:12:15,593
Oh, boy. Look at that rain.

1391
01:12:15,594 --> 01:12:18,054
There goes your ball game.

1392
01:12:18,055 --> 01:12:20,557
It's only a shower.

1393
01:12:20,558 --> 01:12:22,809
Besides, they got the
infield covered.

1394
01:12:22,810 --> 01:12:26,079
Right. Say, could I see that
knife a second, please?

1395
01:12:28,774 --> 01:12:31,192
Well, we're still
tied up six to six.

1396
01:12:31,193 --> 01:12:33,278
Who's got a suggestion?

1397
01:12:33,279 --> 01:12:35,363
It's five after 6:00.
Let's get some dinner.

1398
01:12:35,364 --> 01:12:37,907
Why don't we wait till 7:00,
give it another hour, huh?

1399
01:12:37,908 --> 01:12:40,118
Okay with me.

1400
01:12:40,119 --> 01:12:42,370
Uh, there's something
I'd like to say.

1401
01:12:42,371 --> 01:12:45,999
I mean, it's been bothering me a little,
and as long as we're stuck.

1402
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:49,961
Well, there was this whole business about
the stab wound and how it was made...

1403
01:12:49,962 --> 01:12:51,671
the downward angle of it, you know?

1404
01:12:51,672 --> 01:12:53,757
Don't tell me we're gonna
start with that again.

1405
01:12:53,758 --> 01:12:55,467
They've been over it and over it.

1406
01:12:55,468 --> 01:12:57,844
Well, I know they did,
but I don't go along with it.

1407
01:12:57,845 --> 01:13:01,931
Now, the boy was 5 feet 7
inches tall. His father was 6'2...

1408
01:13:01,932 --> 01:13:04,184
That's a difference
of seven inches.

1409
01:13:04,185 --> 01:13:06,936
It's a very awkward thing to stab
down into the chest of someone...

1410
01:13:06,937 --> 01:13:09,022
who's more than half a
foot taller than you are.

1411
01:13:09,023 --> 01:13:11,232
Give me that.

1412
01:13:11,233 --> 01:13:14,127
I'll give you a demonstration.
Somebody get up.

1413
01:13:15,404 --> 01:13:17,422
You...

1414
01:13:21,827 --> 01:13:24,621
I want you to watch this 'cause
I don't want to have to do it again.

1415
01:13:24,622 --> 01:13:27,457
I'll make myself about six or
seven inches shorter, okay?

1416
01:13:27,458 --> 01:13:30,685
- It's about right. Maybe a little more.
- Okay. A little more.

1417
01:13:38,385 --> 01:13:40,904
That's not funny.

1418
01:13:42,890 --> 01:13:46,826
Now, nobody's hurt. Right?

1419
01:13:47,394 --> 01:13:49,287
Right. Nobody hurt.

1420
01:13:52,650 --> 01:13:57,529
Now, this is the way I'd stab a
man who was taller than I was.

1421
01:13:57,530 --> 01:14:00,073
Look at the angle... down and in.

1422
01:14:00,074 --> 01:14:02,242
And this is the way it was done.

1423
01:14:02,243 --> 01:14:04,510
Now tell me I'm wrong.

1424
01:14:06,622 --> 01:14:10,125
- Down and in. I guess there's no argument.
- Hold it a minute, will ya?

1425
01:14:10,126 --> 01:14:12,060
Can you give me that?

1426
01:14:12,962 --> 01:14:14,963
Boy, I hate these things.

1427
01:14:14,964 --> 01:14:16,714
- Did you ever see a knife fight?
- No.

1428
01:14:16,715 --> 01:14:18,383
- You?
- No.

1429
01:14:18,384 --> 01:14:21,261
Anybody here ever
see a knife fight?

1430
01:14:21,262 --> 01:14:24,139
Well, I have. You know,
on my back stoop...

1431
01:14:24,140 --> 01:14:26,558
the lot across
the street, backyard.

1432
01:14:26,559 --> 01:14:29,060
Switchblades came with the
neighborhood where I lived.

1433
01:14:29,061 --> 01:14:32,397
It's funny I never thought of it before.
I guess you try to forget those things.

1434
01:14:32,398 --> 01:14:35,875
- How do you use a switchblade?
- Well, you'd never use it like this.

1435
01:14:37,528 --> 01:14:39,921
See, you use too much
time switching hands.

1436
01:14:41,574 --> 01:14:44,175
Here's how... underhanded.

1437
01:14:46,787 --> 01:14:49,914
Anyone who's ever used a switch knife
wouldn't handle it any other way.

1438
01:14:49,915 --> 01:14:52,625
- Are you sure?
- I'm sure.

1439
01:14:52,626 --> 01:14:54,544
That's why they're made
to open like that.

1440
01:14:54,545 --> 01:14:56,713
You'd say the boy was
pretty handy with a knife?

1441
01:14:56,739 --> 01:14:57,255
Mm-hmm.

1442
01:14:57,256 --> 01:15:00,508
You think he could have made the kind
of wound that killed his father?

1443
01:15:00,509 --> 01:15:04,512
No. Not with the experience he'd had
all his life handling these things.

1444
01:15:04,513 --> 01:15:06,598
I feel he'd have gone
for him underhanded.

1445
01:15:06,599 --> 01:15:09,726
How do you know? Were you in the
room when the father was killed?

1446
01:15:09,727 --> 01:15:11,811
No. Neither was anybody else.

1447
01:15:11,812 --> 01:15:15,106
So what are you giving us all this
mumbo jumbo for? I don't believe it.

1448
01:15:15,107 --> 01:15:16,757
I don't think you can
determine what type of

1449
01:15:16,783 --> 01:15:18,443
wound the boy might or
might not have made...

1450
01:15:18,444 --> 01:15:21,154
simply because he knew
how to handle a knife.

1451
01:15:21,155 --> 01:15:23,573
What do you think?

1452
01:15:23,574 --> 01:15:25,742
- I don't know.
- What do you mean you don't know?

1453
01:15:25,743 --> 01:15:27,677
I don't know.

1454
01:15:31,790 --> 01:15:33,875
How about you?

1455
01:15:33,876 --> 01:15:35,787
I don't know about the rest
of them, but I'm getting a

1456
01:15:35,788 --> 01:15:37,712
little tired of this
yackety-yackin' back and forth.

1457
01:15:37,713 --> 01:15:41,257
It's gettin' us nowhere. So I
guess I'll have to break it up.

1458
01:15:41,258 --> 01:15:43,885
I change my vote to not guilty.

1459
01:15:43,886 --> 01:15:47,305
- You what?
- You heard me. I've had enough.

1460
01:15:47,306 --> 01:15:49,849
What do you mean you've had enough?
That's no answer!

1461
01:15:49,850 --> 01:15:53,895
Hey, listen. You just take care
of yourself, huh? You know?

1462
01:15:53,896 --> 01:15:57,941
He's right. That's not an answer.

1463
01:15:57,942 --> 01:16:00,985
What kind of a man are you?

1464
01:16:00,986 --> 01:16:04,197
You have sat here and voted
guilty with everyone else...

1465
01:16:04,198 --> 01:16:08,534
because there are some baseball tickets
burning a hole in your pocket.

1466
01:16:08,535 --> 01:16:12,889
And now you've changed your vote because
you say you're sick of all the talking here?

1467
01:16:13,791 --> 01:16:15,333
Now listen, buddy!

1468
01:16:15,334 --> 01:16:20,088
Who tells you that you have the right
to play like this with a man's life?

1469
01:16:20,089 --> 01:16:22,674
- Don't you care...
- Now wait a minute!

1470
01:16:22,675 --> 01:16:26,761
- You can't talk like that to me!
- I can talk like that to you.

1471
01:16:26,762 --> 01:16:28,721
If you want to vote not guilty...

1472
01:16:28,722 --> 01:16:31,182
then do it because you are
convinced the man is not guilty...

1473
01:16:31,183 --> 01:16:33,059
not because you've had enough.

1474
01:16:33,060 --> 01:16:35,728
And if you think he is guilty,
then vote that way.

1475
01:16:35,729 --> 01:16:39,023
Or don't you have the guts to
do what you think is right?

1476
01:16:39,024 --> 01:16:41,376
- Now listen.
- Guilty or not guilty?

1477
01:16:42,069 --> 01:16:45,755
- I told you, not guilty.
- Why?

1478
01:16:47,324 --> 01:16:49,033
Look, I don't have to...

1479
01:16:49,034 --> 01:16:52,245
You do have to! Say it! Why?

1480
01:16:52,246 --> 01:16:54,806
All right. I don't, uh,
think he's guilty.

1481
01:17:04,216 --> 01:17:05,925
I want another vote.

1482
01:17:05,926 --> 01:17:08,511
Okay. There's another
vote called for.

1483
01:17:08,512 --> 01:17:11,472
I guess the quickest way is a
show of hands. Anyone object?

1484
01:17:11,473 --> 01:17:14,492
Okay. All those voting not
guilty, raise your hands.

1485
01:17:15,311 --> 01:17:20,581
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven...

1486
01:17:23,319 --> 01:17:25,086
eight.

1487
01:17:28,907 --> 01:17:31,134
Um, nine.

1488
01:17:32,036 --> 01:17:37,123
Um, all those voting guilty,
raise your hands.

1489
01:17:37,124 --> 01:17:39,584
One, two, three.

1490
01:17:39,585 --> 01:17:42,186
Well, the vote's nine to
three in favor of acquittal.

1491
01:17:43,088 --> 01:17:45,340
I don't understand you people!

1492
01:17:45,341 --> 01:17:47,592
I mean, all these picky little
points you keep bringing up.

1493
01:17:47,593 --> 01:17:51,012
They don't mean nothing!
You saw this kid just like I did.

1494
01:17:51,013 --> 01:17:54,599
You're not gonna tell me you believe that
phony story about losing the knife...

1495
01:17:54,600 --> 01:17:56,684
and that business about
being at the movies.

1496
01:17:56,685 --> 01:17:59,771
Look, you know how these
people lie. It's born in them.

1497
01:17:59,772 --> 01:18:01,898
I mean, what the heck.
I don't have to tell you.

1498
01:18:01,899 --> 01:18:03,941
They don't know what the truth is.

1499
01:18:03,942 --> 01:18:07,737
And let me tell you, they don't need any
real big reason to kill someone either.

1500
01:18:07,738 --> 01:18:09,572
No, sir.

1501
01:18:09,573 --> 01:18:12,700
They get drunk! Oh, they're
real big drinkers, all of 'em.

1502
01:18:12,701 --> 01:18:15,953
You know that. And bang...
someone's lying in the gutter.

1503
01:18:15,954 --> 01:18:19,040
Well, nobody's blaming them for it.
That's the way they are, by nature.

1504
01:18:19,041 --> 01:18:21,209
You know what I mean? Violent!

1505
01:18:21,210 --> 01:18:22,794
Where are you going?

1506
01:18:22,795 --> 01:18:25,897
Human life don't mean as much
to them as it does to us.

1507
01:18:26,799 --> 01:18:29,884
Look! They're lushing it up
and fighting all the time...

1508
01:18:29,885 --> 01:18:31,969
and if somebody gets killed,
so somebody gets killed!

1509
01:18:31,970 --> 01:18:33,429
They don't care!

1510
01:18:33,430 --> 01:18:35,723
Oh, sure, there's some
good things about 'em too.

1511
01:18:35,724 --> 01:18:37,767
Look, I'm the first
one to say that.

1512
01:18:37,768 --> 01:18:41,145
I've known a couple who were okay, but
that's the exception, you know what I mean?

1513
01:18:41,146 --> 01:18:44,982
Most of 'em, it's like they have
no feelings. They can do anything.

1514
01:18:44,983 --> 01:18:47,652
What's going on here?

1515
01:18:47,653 --> 01:18:49,779
I'm... I'm trying to tell ya...

1516
01:18:49,780 --> 01:18:51,864
you're making a big
mistake, you people.

1517
01:18:51,865 --> 01:18:54,967
This kid is a liar! I know it.
I know all about them.

1518
01:18:56,578 --> 01:18:58,830
Listen to me. They're no good.

1519
01:18:58,831 --> 01:19:01,265
There's not a one of
'em who's any good.

1520
01:19:03,210 --> 01:19:05,753
I mean, what...
What's happening in here?

1521
01:19:05,754 --> 01:19:08,105
I'm speaking my piece, and you...

1522
01:19:09,216 --> 01:19:10,983
Listen to me.

1523
01:19:11,969 --> 01:19:13,511
I...

1524
01:19:13,512 --> 01:19:16,055
We're... This kid on
trial here, his type...

1525
01:19:16,056 --> 01:19:18,157
Well, don't you know about them?

1526
01:19:20,018 --> 01:19:23,563
Th-There's...
There's a danger here.

1527
01:19:23,564 --> 01:19:25,731
These people are dangerous.

1528
01:19:25,732 --> 01:19:28,860
They're... wild.

1529
01:19:28,861 --> 01:19:30,862
Listen to me.

1530
01:19:30,863 --> 01:19:33,281
- Listen.
- I have.

1531
01:19:33,282 --> 01:19:36,384
Now sit down and don't
open your mouth again.

1532
01:19:40,205 --> 01:19:43,057
I was only trying to... tell you.

1533
01:20:19,453 --> 01:20:23,848
It's always difficult to keep personal
prejudice out of a thing like this.

1534
01:20:24,875 --> 01:20:28,978
Wherever you run into it,
prejudice always obscures the truth.

1535
01:20:30,464 --> 01:20:32,924
I don't really know
what the truth is.

1536
01:20:32,925 --> 01:20:35,943
I don't suppose anybody
will ever really know.

1537
01:20:37,137 --> 01:20:41,182
Nine of us now seem to feel
that the defendant is innocent.

1538
01:20:41,183 --> 01:20:44,268
But we're just gambling
on probabilities.

1539
01:20:44,269 --> 01:20:46,312
We may be wrong.

1540
01:20:46,313 --> 01:20:48,773
We may be trying to let
a guilty man go free.

1541
01:20:48,774 --> 01:20:50,316
I don't know.

1542
01:20:50,317 --> 01:20:52,401
Nobody really can.

1543
01:20:52,402 --> 01:20:54,862
But we have a reasonable doubt...

1544
01:20:54,863 --> 01:20:58,449
and that's something that's
very valuable in our system.

1545
01:20:58,450 --> 01:21:03,095
No jury can declare a man
guilty unless it's sure.

1546
01:21:04,456 --> 01:21:06,916
We nine can't understand...

1547
01:21:06,917 --> 01:21:09,727
how you three are still so sure.

1548
01:21:10,462 --> 01:21:12,563
- Maybe you can tell us.
- I'll try.

1549
01:21:13,840 --> 01:21:17,426
You've made some excellent points, but I
still believe the boy is guilty of murder...

1550
01:21:17,427 --> 01:21:19,220
and I have two reasons.

1551
01:21:19,221 --> 01:21:22,431
One, the evidence given by the
woman across the street...

1552
01:21:22,432 --> 01:21:25,142
who actually saw the
murder committed.

1553
01:21:25,143 --> 01:21:27,812
As far as I'm concerned,
that's the most important testimony.

1554
01:21:27,813 --> 01:21:31,148
And two, the fact that she described
the stabbing by saying...

1555
01:21:31,149 --> 01:21:36,862
she saw the boy raise his arm over his head
and stab down into the father's chest.

1556
01:21:36,863 --> 01:21:38,990
She saw him do it the wrong way.

1557
01:21:38,991 --> 01:21:40,992
That's absolutely right.

1558
01:21:40,993 --> 01:21:43,661
Let's talk about this
woman for a moment.

1559
01:21:43,662 --> 01:21:46,831
She said she went to bed
about 11:00 that night.

1560
01:21:46,832 --> 01:21:50,501
Her bed was next to the window,
and she could look out while lying down...

1561
01:21:50,502 --> 01:21:54,672
and see directly into the
boy's room across the street.

1562
01:21:54,673 --> 01:21:57,383
She tossed and turned for over
an hour, unable to sleep.

1563
01:21:57,384 --> 01:22:01,637
Finally, she turned toward the window
at about 10 minutes after 12:00...

1564
01:22:01,638 --> 01:22:06,851
and, as she looked out, she saw the killing
through the windows of a passing el train.

1565
01:22:06,852 --> 01:22:09,645
She said the lights went out
immediately after the killing...

1566
01:22:09,646 --> 01:22:14,542
but that she got a good look at the boy
in the act of stabbing his father.

1567
01:22:15,444 --> 01:22:19,380
As far as I can see it,
this is unshakable testimony.

1568
01:22:20,032 --> 01:22:22,800
- Well, that's the whole case.
- What do you think?

1569
01:22:28,081 --> 01:22:29,849
How about you?

1570
01:22:31,376 --> 01:22:33,919
I-I don't know.

1571
01:22:33,920 --> 01:22:36,005
So much evidence to sift.

1572
01:22:36,006 --> 01:22:38,049
This is a pretty
complicated business.

1573
01:22:38,050 --> 01:22:41,927
Frankly, I don't see how you
can vote for acquittal.

1574
01:22:41,928 --> 01:22:44,347
It's not so easy to arrange
all the evidence in order.

1575
01:22:44,348 --> 01:22:46,474
You can throw out
all the other evidence!

1576
01:22:46,475 --> 01:22:50,144
The woman saw him do it!
What else do you want?

1577
01:22:50,145 --> 01:22:52,104
- Yeah, well, maybe...
- Let's vote on it.

1578
01:22:52,105 --> 01:22:54,357
Okay. There's another
vote called for.

1579
01:22:54,358 --> 01:22:56,275
Anybody object?

1580
01:22:56,276 --> 01:22:59,403
All right. I'm changing my vote.
He's guilty.

1581
01:22:59,404 --> 01:23:01,906
Anybody else?
The vote is eight to four.

1582
01:23:01,907 --> 01:23:05,576
Why is this such a personal
triumph for you... this one vote?

1583
01:23:05,577 --> 01:23:09,121
Okay. I say we're a hung jury.
I say we take it in to the judge.

1584
01:23:09,122 --> 01:23:11,916
How about it?
I want to hear arguments.

1585
01:23:11,917 --> 01:23:14,518
You, you're the leader of
the cause. What about it?

1586
01:23:16,672 --> 01:23:18,589
Let's go over it again.

1587
01:23:18,590 --> 01:23:20,591
We've been over it again!

1588
01:23:20,592 --> 01:23:23,170
The boy in the gray flannel
suit here is bouncin'

1589
01:23:23,171 --> 01:23:25,471
backwards and forwards
like a tennis ball.

1590
01:23:25,472 --> 01:23:29,408
No point in getting nasty and
trying to turn this into a contest.

1591
01:23:31,269 --> 01:23:32,812
Okay.

1592
01:23:32,813 --> 01:23:35,940
Maybe we can talk about setting
some kind of time limit.

1593
01:23:35,941 --> 01:23:38,167
Yeah, once around
for the deal, huh?

1594
01:23:38,777 --> 01:23:42,613
It's a quarter after 6:00.

1595
01:23:42,614 --> 01:23:44,657
Someone before mentioned 7:00.

1596
01:23:44,658 --> 01:23:47,118
I think that's a point at which
we might begin to discuss...

1597
01:23:47,119 --> 01:23:50,454
the question of whether
we're a hung jury or not.

1598
01:23:50,455 --> 01:23:52,223
Don't you feel well?

1599
01:23:53,458 --> 01:23:55,501
I feel perfectly well, thank you.

1600
01:23:55,502 --> 01:23:58,295
I was saying that 7:00
would be a reasonable time.

1601
01:23:58,296 --> 01:24:01,298
Uh, the reason I asked about
that was because, uh...

1602
01:24:01,299 --> 01:24:02,967
you were rubbing your nose like...

1603
01:24:02,968 --> 01:24:05,720
Oh, I'm sorry for interrupting...

1604
01:24:05,721 --> 01:24:09,014
but you made a gesture that
reminded me of something.

1605
01:24:09,015 --> 01:24:11,142
I'm trying to settle something
here. Do you mind?

1606
01:24:11,143 --> 01:24:13,244
Well, I think this is important.

1607
01:24:14,229 --> 01:24:16,105
Thank you.

1608
01:24:16,106 --> 01:24:18,816
Now then, I'm sure you'll
pardon me for this...

1609
01:24:18,817 --> 01:24:21,819
but I was wondering why you were
rubbing your nose like that.

1610
01:24:21,820 --> 01:24:23,571
Oh, come on, will ya?

1611
01:24:23,572 --> 01:24:27,825
At this point, I happen to be talking
to the gentleman sitting next to you!

1612
01:24:27,826 --> 01:24:31,162
Now, why were you rubbing
your nose like that?

1613
01:24:31,163 --> 01:24:35,332
Well, if it's any of your business, I was
rubbing it because it bothers me a little.

1614
01:24:35,333 --> 01:24:37,042
Oh. I'm sorry.

1615
01:24:37,043 --> 01:24:41,005
- Is it... Is it because of your eyeglasses?
- It is.

1616
01:24:41,006 --> 01:24:42,840
Now can we get on
to something else?

1617
01:24:42,841 --> 01:24:47,511
Your eyeglasses made those two deep
impressions on the sides of your nose.

1618
01:24:47,512 --> 01:24:49,764
I hadn't noticed that before.

1619
01:24:49,765 --> 01:24:53,350
- That must be annoying.
- It is very annoying.

1620
01:24:53,351 --> 01:24:55,352
Well, I wouldn't know about that.

1621
01:24:55,353 --> 01:24:58,773
I've never worn eyeglasses.
Twenty-twenty.

1622
01:24:58,774 --> 01:25:01,417
Listen, will you come on already
with the optometrist bit?

1623
01:25:03,236 --> 01:25:06,864
The woman who testified
that she saw the killing...

1624
01:25:06,865 --> 01:25:10,509
had those same marks on
the sides of her nose.

1625
01:25:11,411 --> 01:25:13,704
Holy smokes! You know, he's right.

1626
01:25:13,705 --> 01:25:15,456
Please.

1627
01:25:15,457 --> 01:25:19,293
Just give me a minute,
and I'll be finished.

1628
01:25:19,294 --> 01:25:22,213
I don't know if anyone else
noticed that about her.

1629
01:25:22,214 --> 01:25:26,191
I didn't think of it then,
but I've been going over her face...

1630
01:25:27,135 --> 01:25:29,345
in my mind.

1631
01:25:29,346 --> 01:25:31,447
She had those same marks.

1632
01:25:32,349 --> 01:25:36,619
- She kept rubbing them in court.
- He's right. She did do that a lot.

1633
01:25:37,562 --> 01:25:42,316
This woman was about, uh...
about 45 years old.

1634
01:25:42,317 --> 01:25:46,362
She was making a tremendous
effort to look 35...

1635
01:25:46,363 --> 01:25:48,656
for her first public appearance.

1636
01:25:48,657 --> 01:25:51,992
Heavy makeup, dyed hair...

1637
01:25:51,993 --> 01:25:55,955
brand-new clothes that should have
been worn by a younger woman.

1638
01:25:55,956 --> 01:25:57,706
No glasses.

1639
01:25:57,707 --> 01:25:59,458
No, women do that.

1640
01:25:59,459 --> 01:26:01,961
See if you can get the
mental picture of it.

1641
01:26:01,962 --> 01:26:03,879
What do you mean, no glasses?

1642
01:26:03,880 --> 01:26:06,674
How do you know whether she wore glasses?
Just 'cause she was rubbing her nose?

1643
01:26:06,675 --> 01:26:08,968
Now, she had those
marks. I saw 'em.

1644
01:26:08,969 --> 01:26:10,970
So what? What do ya
think that means?

1645
01:26:10,971 --> 01:26:13,238
Listen, I'm getting so sick
of your yelling in here!

1646
01:26:13,264 --> 01:26:14,265
Come on. Forget it.

1647
01:26:14,266 --> 01:26:17,351
Hey, listen. Listen, he's right.
I saw them too.

1648
01:26:17,352 --> 01:26:20,563
I was the closest one to her. She had these,
these things on the side of her nose.

1649
01:26:20,564 --> 01:26:23,858
- What do you call those on the side?
- Well, what point are you making here?

1650
01:26:23,859 --> 01:26:27,820
She had dyed hair, marks on her nose.
Well, what does that mean?

1651
01:26:27,821 --> 01:26:32,216
Could those marks be made by
anything other than eyeglasses?

1652
01:26:35,704 --> 01:26:38,122
No, they couldn't.

1653
01:26:38,123 --> 01:26:40,224
I didn't see any marks!

1654
01:26:41,751 --> 01:26:43,544
I did.

1655
01:26:43,545 --> 01:26:46,171
Strange, but I didn't
think about it before.

1656
01:26:46,172 --> 01:26:48,382
Well, what about the lawyer?
Why didn't he say something?

1657
01:26:48,383 --> 01:26:51,385
There are 12 people in here
concentrating on this case.

1658
01:26:51,386 --> 01:26:53,554
Eleven of us didn't
think of it either.

1659
01:26:53,555 --> 01:26:56,807
Well, what about the district attorney?
Do you think he'd pull a trick like that?

1660
01:26:56,808 --> 01:26:58,784
Have her testify
without her glasses?

1661
01:26:58,810 --> 01:27:00,716
Did you ever see a woman who
had to wear glasses and

1662
01:27:00,717 --> 01:27:02,813
didn't want to because she
thinks they spoil her looks?

1663
01:27:02,814 --> 01:27:06,400
Okay. She had marks on her nose.

1664
01:27:06,401 --> 01:27:10,154
I'm giving you that.
From glasses, right?

1665
01:27:10,155 --> 01:27:14,408
She didn't want to wear 'em out of the house
so people would think she's gorgeous.

1666
01:27:14,409 --> 01:27:19,079
But when she saw this kid killing his
father, she was in the house alone.

1667
01:27:19,080 --> 01:27:21,373
That's all.

1668
01:27:21,374 --> 01:27:25,477
- Do you wear glasses when you go to bed?
- No, I don't.

1669
01:27:27,088 --> 01:27:29,089
No one wears eyeglasses to bed.

1670
01:27:29,090 --> 01:27:32,176
It's logical to assume that she wasn't
wearing them when she was in bed...

1671
01:27:32,177 --> 01:27:34,011
tossing and turning,
trying to fall asleep.

1672
01:27:34,012 --> 01:27:36,430
- How do you know?
- I don't know! I'm guessing.

1673
01:27:36,431 --> 01:27:38,974
I'm also guessing that she probably
didn't put her glasses on...

1674
01:27:38,975 --> 01:27:41,185
when she turned to look
casually out of the window.

1675
01:27:41,186 --> 01:27:44,021
And she herself testified the killing
took place just as she looked out.

1676
01:27:44,022 --> 01:27:45,481
The lights went off a
split second later.

1677
01:27:45,507 --> 01:27:47,149
She couldn't have had
time to put them on then.

1678
01:27:47,150 --> 01:27:48,859
- Wait a second.
- Here's another guess.

1679
01:27:48,860 --> 01:27:53,030
Maybe she honestly thought she saw the boy
kill his father. I say she only saw a blur.

1680
01:27:53,031 --> 01:27:56,700
How do you know what she saw?
How does he know all that?

1681
01:27:56,701 --> 01:27:59,536
How do you know what kind of glasses
she wore? Maybe they were sunglasses.

1682
01:27:59,537 --> 01:28:02,247
Maybe she was farsighted.
What do you know about it?

1683
01:28:02,248 --> 01:28:05,584
I only know the woman's
eyesight is in question now.

1684
01:28:05,585 --> 01:28:11,799
She had to be able to identify a person
60 feet away, at night, without glasses.

1685
01:28:11,800 --> 01:28:14,259
You can't send someone off to
die on evidence like that.

1686
01:28:14,260 --> 01:28:16,345
Oh, don't give me that.

1687
01:28:16,346 --> 01:28:18,597
Don't you think the woman
might have made a mistake?

1688
01:28:18,598 --> 01:28:21,100
- No.
- It's not possible?

1689
01:28:21,101 --> 01:28:22,826
No, it's not possible.

1690
01:28:25,689 --> 01:28:27,706
Is it possible?

1691
01:28:28,733 --> 01:28:30,501
Not guilty.

1692
01:28:34,572 --> 01:28:37,324
Do you think he's guilty?

1693
01:28:37,325 --> 01:28:39,426
I think he's guilty.

1694
01:28:42,080 --> 01:28:43,847
Do you?

1695
01:28:46,626 --> 01:28:49,753
No. I'm convinced.

1696
01:28:49,754 --> 01:28:51,422
Not guilty.

1697
01:28:51,423 --> 01:28:53,298
What's the matter with you?

1698
01:28:53,299 --> 01:28:55,300
I have a reasonable doubt now.

1699
01:28:55,301 --> 01:28:56,927
Eleven to one.

1700
01:28:56,928 --> 01:28:59,930
Well, what about all the other evidence?
What about all that stuff?

1701
01:28:59,931 --> 01:29:02,099
The knife, the whole business!

1702
01:29:02,100 --> 01:29:05,119
Well, you said we could throw
out all the other evidence.

1703
01:29:10,775 --> 01:29:13,043
Well, what do we do now?

1704
01:29:15,947 --> 01:29:17,698
You're alone.

1705
01:29:17,699 --> 01:29:21,635
I don't care whether
I'm alone or not! It's my right.

1706
01:29:24,706 --> 01:29:26,974
It's your right.

1707
01:29:36,009 --> 01:29:38,527
Well, what do you want?
I say he's guilty.

1708
01:29:40,055 --> 01:29:43,490
- We want to hear your arguments.
- I gave you my arguments.

1709
01:29:44,392 --> 01:29:46,602
We're not convinced.

1710
01:29:46,603 --> 01:29:49,480
We want to hear them again.

1711
01:29:49,481 --> 01:29:51,582
We have as much time as it takes.

1712
01:29:57,155 --> 01:30:01,700
Everything... Every single thing
that took place in that courtroom...

1713
01:30:01,701 --> 01:30:03,702
but I mean everything...
says he's guilty.

1714
01:30:03,703 --> 01:30:06,263
What do you think,
I'm an idiot or something?

1715
01:30:07,832 --> 01:30:10,000
Why don't you take that
stuff about the old man?

1716
01:30:10,001 --> 01:30:13,270
The old man who lived there
and heard everything.

1717
01:30:14,839 --> 01:30:16,590
Or this business about the knife.

1718
01:30:16,591 --> 01:30:18,675
What? 'Cause he found another
one exactly like it?

1719
01:30:18,676 --> 01:30:22,096
The old man saw him right
there on the stairs!

1720
01:30:22,097 --> 01:30:25,032
What's the difference how
many seconds it was?

1721
01:30:26,101 --> 01:30:28,202
Every single thing.

1722
01:30:29,521 --> 01:30:32,773
The knife falling through
a hole in his pocket.

1723
01:30:32,774 --> 01:30:36,193
You can't prove he
didn't get to the door.

1724
01:30:36,194 --> 01:30:38,695
Sure, you can take all the time,
hobble around the room.

1725
01:30:38,696 --> 01:30:41,381
But you can't prove it!

1726
01:30:43,201 --> 01:30:46,912
And what about this business
of the el and the movies?

1727
01:30:46,913 --> 01:30:50,040
There's a phony deal
if I ever heard one.

1728
01:30:50,041 --> 01:30:54,336
I'll bet ya $5,000 I'd
remember the movies I saw.

1729
01:30:54,337 --> 01:30:56,672
I'm telling ya, everything
that's gone on...

1730
01:30:56,673 --> 01:31:00,592
has been twisted and turned!

1731
01:31:00,593 --> 01:31:02,761
This business with the glasses?

1732
01:31:02,762 --> 01:31:08,392
How do you know she didn't have them on?
This woman testified in open court!

1733
01:31:08,393 --> 01:31:12,437
And what about hearing
the kid yell, huh?

1734
01:31:12,438 --> 01:31:15,791
I'm telling ya, I've got
all the facts here.

1735
01:31:16,860 --> 01:31:18,835
Here. Ah...

1736
01:31:21,114 --> 01:31:23,715
Well, that's it!
That's the whole case.

1737
01:31:30,832 --> 01:31:32,516
Well?

1738
01:31:34,711 --> 01:31:36,812
Say something!

1739
01:31:41,843 --> 01:31:45,529
You lousy bunch of bleeding hearts.

1740
01:31:46,097 --> 01:31:48,098
You're not gonna intimidate me.

1741
01:31:48,099 --> 01:31:50,701
I'm entitled to my opinion.

1742
01:31:53,980 --> 01:31:58,375
Rotten kids.
You work your life out!

1743
01:32:03,114 --> 01:32:05,173
I can't keep...

1744
01:32:09,746 --> 01:32:11,513
No.

1745
01:32:15,293 --> 01:32:17,227
Not guilty.

1746
01:32:20,506 --> 01:32:22,274
Not guilty.

1747
01:32:25,178 --> 01:32:26,887
Not...

1748
01:32:37,357 --> 01:32:39,624
Um, we're ready now.

1749
01:34:33,181 --> 01:34:34,948
Hey!

1750
01:34:39,187 --> 01:34:40,937
What's your name?

1751
01:34:40,938 --> 01:34:42,522
Davis.

1752
01:34:42,523 --> 01:34:44,541
My name's McCardle.

1753
01:34:46,778 --> 01:34:48,528
Well, so long.

1754
01:34:48,529 --> 01:34:50,130
So long.
