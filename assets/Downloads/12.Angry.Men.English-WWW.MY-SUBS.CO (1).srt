{1719}{1784}You did a wonderful job. Wonderful.
{1832}{1881}You did it. You did it!
{1962}{2089}To continue, you've listened to a long and|complex case, murder in the first degree.
{2091}{2212}Premeditated murder is the most serious|charge tried in our criminal courts.
{2214}{2327}You've listened to the testimony, had the|law interpreted as it applies in this case.
{2329}{2442}lt's now your duty to sit down and try|and separate the facts from the fancy.
{2444}{2546}One man is dead.|Another man's life is at stake.
{2548}{2645}lf there's a reasonable doubt in your|minds as to the guilt of the accused -
{2647}{2762}a reasonable doubt - then you must|bring me a verdict of not guilty.
{2765}{2862}lf there's no reasonable doubt,|then you must, in good conscience,
{2864}{2934}find the accused guilty.
{2936}{3028}However you decide,|your verdict must be unanimous.
{3031}{3113}ln the event that|you find the accused guilty,
{3116}{3194}the bench will not entertain|a recommendation for mercy.
{3197}{3275}The death sentence is mandatory|in this case.
{3284}{3386}You are faced with a grave responsibility.|Thank you, gentlemen.
{3417}{3495}The alternate jurors are excused.
{3604}{3663}The jury will now retire.
{7030}{7098}- Wanna piece of gum?|- No, thanks.
{7106}{7167}This thing isn't movin'.
{7234}{7322}- l'll give you a hand.|- That's it.
{7436}{7516}You know somethin'? l called|the Weather Bureau this morning.
{7519}{7591}This is gonna be|the hottest day of the year.
{7593}{7657}You'd think they'd air-condition this place.
{7659}{7737}- What is your name, sir?|- Oh, it's... that one. Yeah.
{7739}{7839}Thank you very much.|OK, gentlemen. Everybody's here.
{7841}{7964}Now, if there's anything you want,|l'll be right outside the door. Just knock.
{8267}{8333}Good morning.|l never knew they locked the door.
{8335}{8407}Sure they lock the door.|What'd you think?
{8410}{8484}l don't know. lt just never occurred to me.
{8505}{8599}- What's that for?|- l thought we might wanna vote by ballot.
{8602}{8702}Great idea. Maybe we can|get him elected senator.
{8842}{8934}- How'd you like it?|- l don't know. lt was pretty interesting.
{8936}{9049}- Yeah? l almost fell asleep.|- l mean, l've never been on a jury before.
{9052}{9113}No? l've sat on many juries.
{9141}{9270}Those lawyers talk and talk, even when|it's an open-and-shut case like this one.
{9272}{9358}- Ever hear so much talk about nothin'?|- l guess they're entitled.
{9360}{9438}They're entitled. lt's the system, but...
{9440}{9551}if you ask me, l'd slap those tough kids|down before they start any trouble.
{9553}{9637}lt saves a lot of time and money.|Let's get started.
{9640}{9704}Yeah. We've probably all|got things to do here.
{9706}{9800}We can start with a five-minute break.|One gentleman is in the bathroom.
{9803}{9852}Are... we gonna sit in order?
{9855}{9920}Gee, l don't know. l guess so.
{10035}{10094}- Buddy, you're in my seat.|- Oh, excuse me.
{10097}{10146}That's all right.
{10177}{10242}Hey, that's not a bad view, huh?
{10309}{10418}What did you think of the case?|l mean, it had a lot of interest for me.
{10421}{10513}No real... dead spots.|You know what l mean?
{10515}{10626}We were lucky to get a murder case.|l figured us for an assault or burglary.
{10628}{10693}Boy, they can be the dullest!
{10719}{10844}- Hey, is that the Woolworth Building?|- That's right.
{10847}{10941}lsn't that funny? l've lived here all my life.|l've never been inside it.
{10944}{11041}lf you had to sort out all that junk,|like that thing with the movies.
{11043}{11115}Yeah. What about|that business with the knife?
{11117}{11189}Asking grown-up people|to believe that kind ofjazz.
{11192}{11258}You expect that.|You know what we're dealing with.
{11260}{11299}Yeah, l guess so.
{11314}{11386}Well, your horn works.|Now try your lights.
{11388}{11484}- You got a cold?|- And how. Hot-weather colds can kill you.
{11486}{11545}l can hardly touch my nose.|Know what l mean?
{11547}{11612}Sure do. l just got over one.
{11632}{11741}- Oh, come on! Mr Foreman, let's go.|- The guy's still in the bathroom.
{11744}{11836}What's new? l didn't get a chance|to see a paper this morning.
{11838}{11895}l was only wondering|how the market closed.
{11898}{12005}- You got a seat on the exchange?|- l'm a broker.
{12008}{12057}l run a messenger service.
{12060}{12115}The Beck and Call Company.
{12118}{12171}The name is my wife's idea.
{12174}{12258}Got 377 men workin'. Started with nothin'.
{12261}{12326}OK, men. Let's take our seats, huh?
{12413}{12538}We can all get out of here pretty quick.|l have tickets to that ball game tonight.
{12541}{12631}Yanks and Cleveland. We've got|this kid Modjelewski in there.
{12634}{12689}He's a real bull, this kid. You know...
{12720}{12771}Real jug-handled. You know?
{12836}{12930}You're a real baseball fan, aren't ya?|Where do we sit here?
{12933}{13005}l thought we'd sit in order,|by jury numbers.
{13008}{13096}One, two, three and so on around the|table, if that's OK with you gentlemen.
{13099}{13173}- What's the difference?|- lt's reasonable to sit in order.
{13175}{13335}- Let it be.|- That's twelve. We go around one, two...
{13337}{13435}What was your impression|of the prosecuting attorney?
{13437}{13504}- l beg pardon?|- l thought he was really sharp,
{13506}{13598}the way he handled all those points|one by one, in logical sequence.
{13601}{13718}- l was very impressed.|- l think he... he did an expert job.
{13720}{13796}A lot of drive, too. You know? Real drive.
{13799}{13881}OK, fellas. Can we|hold it down a minute? Fellas?
{13884}{13935}Say, we'd like to get started.
{13938}{14007}Gentleman at the window.
{14009}{14085}- We'd like to get started.|- Oh, l'm sorry.
{14087}{14208}- The kid kills his father, just like that.|- Listen, it happens all the time.
{14210}{14265}They let those kids run wild up there.
{14267}{14338}Well, maybe it serves him right.|You know what l mean?
{14340}{14411}- ls everyone here?|- The old man is inside.
{14413}{14479}- Would you knock on the door for him?|- Yeah.
{14505}{14581}- Are you a Yankee fan?|- No, Baltimore.
{14591}{14640}Baltimore?
{14658}{14755}That's like being hit in the head|with a crowbar once a day.
{14757}{14847}Who have they got? Who have they got|besides good groundkeepers?
{14850}{14926}- Say, we'd like to get started.|- Forgive me, gentlemen.
{14929}{15017}- l didn't mean to keep you waiting.|- Baltimore?
{15026}{15164}OK, if l can have your attention. You fellas|can handle this thing any way you want.
{15167}{15233}l'm... you know,|l'm not gonna make any rules.
{15235}{15377}We can, well, discuss it first, then vote|on it. That's, of course... that's one way.
{15380}{15446}And, well, we can vote on it right now.
{15448}{15514}l think it's customary|to take a preliminary vote.
{15516}{15608}Yeah, let's vote. Who knows?|Maybe we can all get outta here.
{15645}{15793}OK. Then l think that you know that we|have a first-degree murder charge here,
{15795}{15918}and if we vote the accused guilty,|we've got to send him to the chair.
{15920}{15983}Um... That's mandatory.
{15985}{16057}- l think we know that.|- Yeah, let's see who's where.
{16060}{16148}- OK. Anyone doesn't wanna vote?|- lt's fine with me.
{16178}{16307}OK, then, just remember that this|has to be twelve to nothing, either way.
{16309}{16381}That's the law. OK, are we ready?
{16384}{16468}All those voting guilty,|please raise your hands.
{16547}{16643}One, two, three, four, five, six, seven...
{16665}{16722}eight, nine, ten, eleven.
{16725}{16784}OK, that's eleven guilty.
{16798}{16847}Those voting not guilty?
{16859}{16912}One. Right.
{16914}{17029}Eleven guilty, one not guilty.|Well, now we know where we are.
{17031}{17107}Boy, oh boy! There's always one.
{17139}{17204}So, what do we do now?
{17206}{17280}- l guess we talk.|- Boy, oh boy!
{17282}{17352}You really think he's innocent?
{17415}{17493}- l don't know.|- You sat in court with the rest of us.
{17495}{17571}You heard what we did.|The kid's a dangerous killer.
{17573}{17655}- He's 18 years old.|- Well, that's old enough.
{17658}{17727}He stabbed his own father|four inches into the chest.
{17729}{17793}They proved it|a dozen different ways in court.
{17795}{17879}- Would you like me to list 'em for you?|- No.
{17887}{17959}- Then what do you want?|- l just want to talk.
{17961}{18037}What's there to talk about?|Eleven of us think he's guilty.
{18039}{18094}No one had to think about it twice|except you.
{18097}{18173}l want to ask you something.|Do you believe his story?
{18175}{18278}- l don't know. Maybe l don't.|- So how come you voted not guilty?
{18280}{18325}There were eleven votes for guilty.
{18327}{18448}lt's not easy to raise my hand and send a|boy off to die without talking about it first.
{18451}{18535}- Well, now, who says it's easy?|- No one.
{18538}{18653}What? Just because l voted fast?|l honestly think the guy is guilty.
{18655}{18719}Couldn't change my mind|if you talked for 100 years.
{18721}{18786}l'm not trying to change your mind.|lt's just that...
{18788}{18862}This is somebody's life.|We can't decide in five minutes.
{18865}{18970}- Supposing we're wrong?|- Supposing this building fell on my head?
{18973}{19042}- You can suppose anything.|- That's right.
{19044}{19165}What's the difference how long it takes?|Supposin' we take five minutes? So what?
{19167}{19284}Let's take an hour. The ball game|doesn't start till eight o'clock.
{19399}{19481}- Who's got something to say?|- l'm willing to sit for an hour.
{19483}{19611}- Great. l heard a good story last night...|- That's not why we're sitting here.
{19613}{19713}All right, then you tell me.|What are we sitting here for?
{19729}{19796}l don't know. Maybe no reason.
{19798}{19880}Look, this kid's been|kicked around all of his life.
{19883}{19973}You know, born in a slum,|mother dead since he was nine.
{19976}{20033}He lived for a year and a half|in an orphanage
{20035}{20106}when his father was serving|a jail term for forgery.
{20108}{20163}That's not a very happy beginning.
{20166}{20254}He's a wild, angry kid. That's all|he's ever been. And you know why?
{20256}{20348}Cos he's been hit on the head|by somebody once a day, every day.
{20351}{20478}He's had a pretty miserable 18 years.|l think we owe him a few words, that's all.
{20480}{20593}l don't mind telling you this, mister. We|don't owe him a thing. He got a fair trial.
{20596}{20705}What do you think that trial cost?|He's lucky he got it. Know what l mean?
{20707}{20810}Look, we're all grown-ups in here.|We heard the facts, didn't we?
{20812}{20915}You're not gonna tell me we're supposed|to believe this kid, knowing what he is.
{20918}{20971}l've lived among them all my life.
{20974}{21101}You can't believe a word they say.|You know that. l mean, they're born liars.
{21103}{21181}- Only an ignorant man can believe that.|- Now, listen...
{21183}{21252}Do you think you were born|with a monopoly on the truth?
{21254}{21321}Certain things should be|pointed out to this man.
{21323}{21444}- lt's not Sunday. We don't need a sermon.|- We have a job to do. Now let's do it.
{21447}{21537}Rice Pops. lt's a product|l work on at the agency.
{21540}{21601}''The breakfast with the built-in bounce.''
{21603}{21660}- l wrote that line.|- Very catchy.
{21662}{21773}- Say, do you mind?|- l'm sorry. l have this habit of doodling.
{21776}{21847}- lt keeps me thinking clearly.|- We have work to do.
{21849}{21923}There's no point|staying here for ever. OK.
{21936}{22084}Perhaps if the gentleman down there who|is disagreeing with us could tell us why.
{22086}{22183}Tell us what you're thinking. We might be|able to show you where you're mixed up.
{22185}{22346}Maybe this is an idea. lt seems to me that|it's up to us to convince this gentleman
{22348}{22483}that he's wrong and we're right. Maybe if|we each took a couple of minutes just to...
{22485}{22577}- Well, it was just a quick idea.|- No, no, no. That's a good one.
{22580}{22629}Supposing we go once around the table?
{22634}{22681}l guess you're first.
{22774}{22835}lt's hard to put into words.
{22856}{22911}l just think he's guilty.
{22913}{23003}l thought it was obvious from the word go.|Nobody proved otherwise.
{23006}{23102}Nobody has to prove otherwise.|The burden of proof's on the prosecution.
{23104}{23206}The defendant doesn't even have to open|his mouth. That's in the Constitution.
{23208}{23310}Sure, l know that. What l meant was...
{23328}{23416}Well... l just think he's guilty.|l mean, somebody saw him do it.
{23419}{23544}OK. Here's what l think. And l have|no personal feelings about this.
{23547}{23619}l just wanna talk about facts.
{23622}{23679}Number one.
{23682}{23783}The old man lived downstairs under|the room where the killing took place.
{23785}{23873}At 10 minutes after 12 on the night|of the killing, he heard loud noises.
{23876}{23925}Said it sounded like a fight.
{23928}{23995}And he heard the kid yell out|''l'm gonna kill ya.''
{23997}{24052}A second later,|he heard a body hit the floor.
{24055}{24160}Ran to the door, opened it up, saw the kid|run down the stairs and out of the house.
{24163}{24257}Called the police. They found the old man|with the knife in his chest.
{24259}{24337}The coroner fixed the time of death|around midnight.
{24339}{24467}Now, these are facts.|You can't refute facts. The kid is guilty.
{24469}{24547}l'm just as sentimental as the next fella.|l know he's only 18.
{24550}{24650}- But he's still gotta pay for what he did.|- l'm with you.
{24652}{24744}- OK. Are you finished?|- Yeah.
{24747}{24831}lt is obvious to me that|the boy's entire story was flimsy.
{24833}{24878}He claimed he was at the movies,
{24881}{24975}yet he couldn't remember the names|of the films he saw or who played in them.
{24978}{25045}- That's right.|- And no one saw him at the theatre.
{25047}{25152}And the woman across the street - if her|testimony don't prove it, nothing does.
{25154}{25261}- That's right. She actually saw the killing.|- Fellas, please. Let's go in order.
{25263}{25312}Just a minute. Here's a woman...
{25345}{25454}Here's a woman who's lying in bed.|She can't sleep. She's dyin' with the heat.
{25457}{25531}She looks out the window,|and right across the street
{25533}{25619}she sees the kid stick the knife|into his father.
{25622}{25696}The time is 12.10 on the nose.|Everything fits.
{25699}{25754}She's known the kid all his life.
{25756}{25848}His window is opposite hers across the|el tracks. She swore she saw him do it.
{25851}{25912}Through the windows|of a passing el train.
{25915}{26017}This el train had no passengers on it.|lt was just being moved downtown.
{26019}{26099}The lights were out,|and they proved in court that at night
{26101}{26193}you can look through the windows and|see what's happening on the other side.
{26195}{26271}- They proved it.|- l'd like to ask you something.
{26273}{26343}You don't believe the boy.|How come you believe the woman?
{26345}{26423}She's one of ''them'' too, isn't she?
{26450}{26544}- You're a pretty smart fella, aren't ya?|- OK, gentlemen. Now, gentlemen.
{26546}{26649}- Come on, sit down. Sit down.|- What's he so wise about? l'm telling ya...
{26651}{26729}Come on. Now we're not gonna|get anywhere fighting.
{26732}{26834}- Whose turn is it next?|- Oh, his. Number five.
{26912}{26973}May l... Can l pass?
{26976}{27045}Well... That's your privilege.
{27047}{27100}How about the next gentleman?
{27103}{27164}Oh. Well... l don't know.
{27167}{27278}l started to be convinced,|you know, very early in the case.
{27281}{27357}You see, l was looking for a motive.
{27360}{27493}That's very important because if you don't|have a motive, where's your case, right?
{27495}{27633}Anyway, that testimony from those people|across the hall from the kid's apartment,
{27635}{27765}that was very powerful. Didn't they say|something about a fight, an argument,
{27767}{27870}between the old man and his son|around about seven o'clock that night?
{27872}{27952}- l could be wrong but...|- lt was eight o'clock, not seven.
{27954}{28092}They heard an argument. Then|they heard the father hit the boy twice.
{28095}{28197}Finally they saw the boy run, angry,|out of the house. What does that prove?
{28199}{28271}lt don't prove anything.|lt's just part of the picture.
{28273}{28349}You said it provided a motive.|So did the prosecution.
{28351}{28402}That wasn't a very strong motive.
{28404}{28498}This boy has been hit so many times|that violence is practically...
{28500}{28555}lt's a normal state of affairs with him.
{28558}{28660}l just can't see two slaps in the face|provoking him into committing murder.
{28662}{28771}lt may have been two too many.|Everyone has a breaking point.
{28802}{28857}Anything else?
{28859}{28939}- No.|- OK. How about you?
{29002}{29084}l don't know. lt's all been said.
{29086}{29168}You can talk here for ever.|lt's still the same thing.
{29178}{29295}This kid is five for 0.|Well, look at his record.
{29297}{29400}When he was 10, he was in children's|court: he threw a rock at a teacher.
{29402}{29500}When he was 15, he was|in reform school: he stole a car.
{29502}{29617}He's been arrested for muggin'.|He was picked up twice for knife fightin'.
{29620}{29733}They say he's real handy with a knife.|Oh, this is a very fine boy.
{29735}{29844}Ever since he was five, his father|beat him up regularly. He used his fists.
{29846}{29905}So would l. A kid like that?
{29908}{29988}lt's these kids -|the way they are nowadays.
{30042}{30130}When l was a kid,|l used to call my father ''sir''.
{30133}{30209}That's right. Ever hear a kid|call his father that any more?
{30211}{30291}Fathers don't seem to think|it's important any more.
{30294}{30351}- You got any kids?|- Three.
{30377}{30426}l got one.
{30449}{30498}He's 22 years old.
{30635}{30742}When he was nine years old,|he ran away from a fight.
{30744}{30859}l saw it. l was so embarrassed,|l almost threw up.
{30861}{30992}l said ''l'm gonna make a man out of you|if l have to break you in two tryin'.''
{31030}{31095}Well, l made a man out of him.
{31097}{31162}When he was 16, we had a fight.
{31192}{31266}Hit me in the jaw. He was a big kid.
{31328}{31399}l haven't seen him for two years.
{31457}{31506}Kids.
{31517}{31566}You work your heart out...
{31627}{31711}- Well, let's get goin'.|- l think we're missing the point.
{31714}{31802}This boy's the product of a broken home|and a filthy neighbourhood.
{31804}{31888}We can't help that. We're here|to decide his innocence or guilt,
{31890}{31961}not to go into the reasons|why he grew up the way he did.
{31963}{32072}He was born in a slum.|Slums are breeding grounds for criminals.
{32074}{32205}lt's no secret that children from slums|are potential menaces to society. l think...
{32207}{32308}You can say that again. The kids who|crawl out of these places are real trash.
{32310}{32440}- l don't want any part of them.|- Listen, l... l've lived in a slum all my life.
{32442}{32485}- Wait a minute.|- Please. l...
{32488}{32559}l've played in back yards|that were filled with garbage.
{32561}{32628}- Maybe you can still smell it on me.|- Listen, sonny...
{32630}{32687}Come on, now. There's nothing personal.
{32689}{32775}Come on, fella. He didn't mean you.|Let's not be so sensitive.
{32777}{32842}This sensitivity l can understand.
{32844}{32959}OK, look. Let's stop the arguing.|We're only wasting time.
{32962}{33021}Your turn down there. Let's go.
{33048}{33142}l didn't expect a turn. l thought|you were all gonna to try to convince me.
{33144}{33197}- That was the idea.|- l forgot. He's right.
{33199}{33279}He's the one keeping us in here.|Let's hear what he's got to say.
{33281}{33373}Wait. We decided to do this a certain way.|l think we ought to stick to it.
{33376}{33431}Oh, stop being a kid, will ya?
{33433}{33544}- What do you mean, a kid?|- What do you think l mean? K-l-D: kid.
{33604}{33670}Just because l'm trying|to keep this organised?
{33672}{33773}Here, you take on the responsibility.|l'll just keep my mouth shut.
{33775}{33855}- Why are you gettin' so hot? Calm down.|- Don't tell me to calm down.
{33858}{33915}You want to take the chair?|Take the chair.
{33917}{33974}Did you ever see such a thing?
{33976}{34056}- You think it's funny?|- Forget it, fella. lt's unimportant.
{34058}{34103}Unimportant? Here, you try it.
{34106}{34180}Nobody wants to change.|You're doing a beautiful job.
{34183}{34318}Yeah, you're doin' great. Just great, fella.|You stay in there and pitch.
{34320}{34406}All right, let's hear from somebody.
{34409}{34509}Well, if you want me to tell you|how l feel about it, it's all right with me.
{34511}{34630}- Boy, l don't care what you do.|- All right. l don't have anything brilliant.
{34632}{34683}l only know as much as you do.
{34686}{34774}According to the testimony,|the boy looks guilty. Maybe he is.
{34776}{34889}l sat there in court for six days|listening while the evidence built up.
{34891}{34940}Everybody sounded so positive.
{34943}{35060}l began to get a peculiar feeling about|this trial. l mean, nothing is that positive.
{35063}{35168}There are questions l'd have liked to ask.|Maybe they wouldn't mean anything but...
{35171}{35286}l felt that the defence wasn't conducting|a thorough enough cross-examination.
{35288}{35358}He let too many things go by - little things.
{35360}{35428}What little things?|When they don't ask questions,
{35430}{35500}it's because they know|the answers already.
{35502}{35619}lt's also possible for a lawyer to be just|plain stupid, isn't it? l mean, it's possible.
{35622}{35696}You sound like you met|my brother-in-law once.
{35744}{35896}l kept putting myself in the kid's place.|l'd have asked for another lawyer, l think.
{35899}{35956}l mean, if l was on trial for my life,
{35959}{36078}l'd want my lawyer to tear the prosecution|witnesses to shreds, or at least try to.
{36081}{36183}Look, there was one alleged|eyewitness to this killing.
{36185}{36269}Someone else claims he heard the killing,|saw the boy run out after,
{36272}{36325}and there was circumstantial evidence.
{36327}{36421}But those two witnesses|were the entire case for the prosecution.
{36424}{36459}Supposing they're wrong?
{36461}{36541}What do you mean? What's the point|of having witnesses at all?
{36543}{36648}- Could they be wrong?|- Those people were under oath.
{36650}{36746}They're only people. People|make mistakes. Could they be wrong?
{36748}{36822}- Well, no. l don't think so.|- Do you know so?
{36824}{36906}Nobody can know a thing like that.|This isn't an exact science.
{36909}{36968}That's right, it isn't.
{37065}{37124}OK, let's get to the point.
{37127}{37201}What about the switch knife|they found in the old man's chest?
{37204}{37280}Some people haven't talked yet.|Shouldn't we go in order?
{37283}{37369}They'll get a chance to talk.|Be quiet a second, will ya?
{37371}{37482}What about the knife this fine, upright boy|admitted buying the night of the killing?
{37485}{37571}- Let's talk about it.|- All right. Let's get it in here and look at it.
{37574}{37695}- l'd like to see it again. Mr Foreman?|- Why do we have to see it again?
{37697}{37783}The gentleman has a right|to see exhibits in evidence.
{37801}{37881}- Say, could you bring us the knife?|- The knife? Sure.
{37913}{37999}The knife and the way it was bought|is strong evidence, don't you think?
{38002}{38094}- l do.|- Good. Let's take the facts one at a time.
{38096}{38178}One: the boy admitted leaving the house|at eight o'clock at night
{38180}{38233}after being slapped by his father.
{38235}{38352}No, he didn't say ''slapped''.|He said ''punched''. There's a difference.
{38354}{38415}After being hit several times by his father.
{38417}{38513}Two: he went directly to a local junk shop|where he bought one of those...
{38515}{38572}- Switch knives.|- Switchblade knives.
{38575}{38688}This wasn't an ordinary knife. lt had|a very unusual carved handle and blade.
{38690}{38799}The storekeeper said it was the only one|of its kind he had ever had in stock.
{38801}{38926}Three: he met some friends of his in front|of a tavern about 8.45. Am l right so far?
{38929}{38978}- Yes, you are.|- You bet he is.
{38980}{39062}He talked with his friends|for an hour, leaving them at 9.45.
{39065}{39132}During this time,|they saw the switch knife.
{39134}{39299}Four: they identified the death weapon|in court as that very same knife.
{39301}{39369}Five: he arrived home|at about ten o'clock.
{39371}{39474}This is where the stories offered|by the State and the boy diverge slightly.
{39476}{39535}He claims that he went to a movie|at about 11.30,
{39538}{39641}returning home at 37.10 to find|his father dead and himself arrested.
{39643}{39741}He also claims that the two detectives|threw him down a half a flight of stairs.
{39743}{39835}What happened to the knife? He claims|it fell through a hole in his pocket
{39838}{39928}on the way to the movies,|sometime between 11.30 and 3.10,
{39930}{40018}and that he never saw it again.|Now, there is a tale, gentlemen.
{40020}{40098}l think it's clear the boy|never went to the movies that night.
{40101}{40191}No one in the house saw him go out.|No one at the theatre identified him.
{40194}{40272}He couldn't even remember|the names of the pictures he saw.
{40314}{40361}What actually happened is this.
{40364}{40442}The boy stayed home,|had another fight with his father,
{40445}{40529}stabbed him to death and left the house|at 10 minutes after 12.
{40531}{40598}He even wiped the knife|clean of fingerprints.
{40600}{40705}Are you trying to tell me that this knife|fell through a hole in the boy's pocket,
{40708}{40765}someone picked it up,|went to the boy's house
{40767}{40838}and stabbed his father with it|just to test its sharpness?
{40840}{40893}No, but it's possible the boy lost his knife
{40896}{40970}and somebody else stabbed his father|with a similar knife.
{40972}{41031}Take a look at this knife.
{41056}{41109}lt's a very unusual knife.
{41111}{41213}l've never seen one like it. Neither had|the storekeeper who sold it to the boy.
{41215}{41293}Aren't you asking us to accept|an incredible coincidence?
{41295}{41410}- l'm just saying a coincidence is possible.|- And l say it's not possible.
{41549}{41596}Where did that come from?
{41598}{41665}- lt's the same knife!|- What do you think you're doin'?
{41667}{41755}- Where did you get it?|- l went out walking last night.
{41758}{41807}Through the boy's neighbourhood.
{41810}{41937}l bought that at a pawn shop two blocks|from the boy's house. lt cost six dollars.
{41939}{42005}lt's against the law|to buy or sell switchblade knives.
{42007}{42083}- That's right. l broke the law.|- You pulled a real bright trick.
{42086}{42145}Now supposing you tell me what it proves.
{42148}{42226}- Maybe there are ten knives like that.|- Maybe there are!
{42228}{42347}What does it mean? You found a knife like|it. What's that? The discovery of the age?
{42350}{42451}You think somebody else did the stabbing|with exactly the same kind of knife?
{42453}{42525}- The odds are a million to one.|- lt's possible!
{42527}{42627}- But not very probable.|- OK, fellas. Let's take our seats.
{42629}{42713}There's no point standing around|all over the place.
{42716}{42804}lt's interesting that he'd find a knife|exactly like the boy's.
{42807}{42916}- What's interesting about it? lnteresting!|- l just thought it was interesting.
{42919}{42974}Eleven of us still think he's guilty.
{42977}{43069}Right. You're not gonna|change anybody's mind.
{43071}{43126}lf you wanna hang this jury, go ahead.
{43128}{43228}The kid'll be tried again|and found guilty, as sure as he's born.
{43236}{43287}You're probably right.
{43289}{43357}So, what are you gonna do?|We can be here all night.
{43359}{43437}lt's only one night. A boy may die.
{43440}{43506}Well, why don't we just|set up house here?
{43508}{43563}Someone send for a pinochle deck
{43566}{43654}and we'll just sweat|the whole thing out right here.
{43656}{43748}- l don't think he oughta joke about it.|- What do you want me to do about it?
{43750}{43824}l don't see what the knife|has got to do with anything.
{43827}{43897}Somebody saw the kid stab his father.|What more do we need?
{43899}{43967}You guys can talk the ears|right off my head.
{43969}{44078}l got three garages going to pot.|So let's get done and get outta here.
{44080}{44166}The knife was important to the|district attorney. He spent a day...
{44168}{44236}He's a 15th assistant or something.|What does he know?
{44238}{44341}Let's hold it down. These side arguments|are only slowin' us up.
{44385}{44465}- Well, what about it?|- You're the only one.
{44643}{44791}l have a proposition to make to all of you.|l'm going to call for another vote.
{44793}{44860}l want you eleven men to...
{44862}{44919}vote by secret written ballot.
{44931}{45042}l'll abstain. lf there are eleven votes|for guilty, l won't stand alone.
{45044}{45161}We'll take in a guilty verdict|to the judge right now.
{45164}{45289}But if anyone votes not guilty,|we'll stay here and talk it out.
{45334}{45449}- That's it. lf you want to try it, l'm ready.|- All right. Let's do it the hard way.
{45452}{45544}That sounds fair. Everyone agreed?|Anyone doesn't agree?
{45546}{45595}OK, pass these along.
{46383}{46432}Guilty.
{46476}{46515}Guilty.
{46558}{46597}Guilty.
{46637}{46676}Guilty.
{46706}{46745}Guilty.
{46779}{46818}Guilty.
{46858}{46897}Guilty.
{46910}{46949}Guilty.
{46974}{47013}Guilty.
{47112}{47159}Not guilty.
{47162}{47199}Guilty.
{47201}{47301}- Boy, how do you like that?|- And another chap flips his wings!
{47303}{47371}All right. Who was it?|Come on, l wanna know.
{47373}{47461}Excuse me. This was a secret ballot.|We all agreed on that, no?
{47463}{47522}lf the gentleman|wants it to remain secret...
{47524}{47658}Secret? What do you mean? There are no|secrets in a jury room. l know who it was.
{47660}{47762}Brother, you really are somethin'.|You vote guilty like the rest of us,
{47764}{47840}then some golden-voiced preacher|tears your heart out -
{47843}{47921}some underprivileged kid|couldn't help becoming a murderer -
{47924}{48014}and you change your vote.|lf that isn't the most sickening...
{48016}{48098}Why don't you drop a quarter|in his collection box?
{48101}{48212}Oh, now just wait a... Listen, you can't talk|to me like that. Who do you think you are?
{48215}{48282}Calm down, calm down. lt doesn't matter.
{48284}{48370}- He's very excitable. Sit down.|- Excitable? You bet l'm excitable!
{48373}{48453}We're tryin' to put a guilty man|in the chair, where he belongs.
{48455}{48543}Someone starts tellin' us|fairy tales and we're listenin'!
{48560}{48677}- What made you change your vote?|- He didn't change his vote. l did.
{48680}{48727}- Oh, fine.|- l knew it.
{48730}{48822}- Would you like me to tell you why?|- No, l wouldn't like you to tell me why.
{48825}{48923}- l'd like to anyway, if you don't mind.|- Do we have to listen to this?
{48925}{49009}- The man wants to talk.|- Thank you.
{49011}{49091}This gentleman has been|standing alone against us.
{49094}{49147}He doesn't say the boy is not guilty.
{49150}{49267}He just isn't sure. lt's not easy to stand|alone against the ridicule of others.
{49270}{49383}So he gambled for support and l gave it|to him. l respect his motives.
{49386}{49497}The boy on trial is probably guilty,|but... l want to hear more.
{49500}{49588}The vote is ten to two. l'm talking!|You have no right to leave this room!
{49590}{49668}He can't hear you. He never will.|Let's sit down.
{49793}{49890}- Shall we continue?|- Well, l think we ought to take a break.
{49892}{50003}You know, one man's inside and|l think we ought to wait for him.
{50069}{50137}Looks like we're really|hung up here, huh?
{50139}{50246}l mean, that thing with the old man,|that was pretty unexpected.
{50249}{50335}Wish l could figure out some way|we could break it up.
{50380}{50489}You know, in advertising...|l told you l worked in an agency?
{50492}{50584}Some pretty strange people work there.|Well, not strange, really.
{50586}{50689}l guess it's just they have peculiar ways|of expressing themselves.
{50691}{50763}l suppose it's the same|in your business too, huh?
{50765}{50826}- What do you do?|- l'm a watchmaker.
{50828}{50927}Really? l imagine the finest watchmakers|in the world come from Europe.
{50929}{51001}Anyway, in an agency,|when we reach a point like this...
{51003}{51095}l'm telling him, in an ad agency when|a point like this is reached in a meeting,
{51097}{51171}there's always some character|ready with an idea, see.
{51174}{51231}lt kills me. lt's the weirdest thing,
{51234}{51306}the way they sometimes precede|their idea with a phrase.
{51309}{51397}Like, some account exec|will get up and he'll say:
{51400}{51552}''OK, here's an idea. Let's... run it up|the flagpole and see if anyone salutes it.''
{51554}{51615}l mean, it's idiotic, but it's funny.
{51617}{51703}l... got a little excited back there.
{51706}{51777}l... didn't mean to get nasty.
{51809}{51937}Glad you're not one of those who lets|these emotional appeals influence him.
{52299}{52364}l don't know what's the matter|with that fan.
{52598}{52676}- Are you a salesman?|- l'm an architect.
{52741}{52809}You know what the soft sell is?
{52866}{52938}Well, you've got it, believe me.
{52951}{53012}l've got a different technique.
{53014}{53108}Laughs, drinks, jokes, tricks. You know?
{53133}{53182}Yeah.
{53198}{53280}Hit 'em where they live - that's my motto.
{53282}{53370}l made 27 grand last year|sellin' marmalade.
{53373}{53459}That's not bad. l mean, you know,|considerin' marmalade.
{53510}{53575}What are you gettin' out of this? Kicks?
{53593}{53681}Or did somebody bump you on the head|once and you haven't gotten over it?
{53684}{53787}- Maybe.|- You know, you do-gooders are all alike.
{53790}{53901}You're always blowin' your stacks|over some guy that fanned.
{53930}{53995}But what are you wastin' our time for?
{53997}{54129}Why don't you donate five dollars to the|cause? Maybe it'll make you feel better.
{54169}{54220}This kid is guilty, pal.
{54223}{54338}lt's as plain as the nose on your face. So|why don't we stop wastin' our time here?
{54340}{54409}We're gonna all get sore throats|if we keep it up.
{54411}{54503}What difference does it make|if you get it here or at the ball game?
{54505}{54562}No difference, pal.
{54565}{54614}No difference at all.
{54895}{55014}- Nice bunch of guys, huh?|- They're about the same as anyone else.
{55016}{55075}Boy, what a murderous day.
{55086}{55176}- Do you think we'll be much longer?|- l don't know.
{55178}{55266}He's guilty for sure.|Not a doubt in the whole world.
{55269}{55359}We should've...|We should've been done already.
{55381}{55438}Oh, l don't mind, you know.
{55441}{55490}Beats workin'.
{55643}{55750}- You think he's not guilty, huh?|- l don't know. lt's possible.
{55753}{55850}Well, l don't know you, but l'm bettin'|you've never been wronger in your life.
{55852}{55909}You're wastin' your time.|You ought to wrap it up.
{55912}{55981}Supposing you were the one|who was on trial?
{55983}{56061}Well, l'm not used to supposin'.|l'm just a workin' man.
{56063}{56134}My boss does the supposin'. But...
{56136}{56185}l'll try one.
{56205}{56287}Supposin' you talk us all out of this and...
{56290}{56382}the kid really did knife his father, huh?
{56556}{56605}Are you ready?
{56640}{56689}Sorry, blue eyes.
{56707}{56781}- Well, where else?|- OK, fellas. Let's take our seats.
{56784}{56895}- Looks like we'll be here for dinner.|- OK, now let's get down to business.
{56898}{56941}- Who wants to start?|- l will.
{56944}{57013}- OK, go.|- You, down there.
{57015}{57112}The old man who lived downstairs says|he heard the kid yell ''l'm gonna kill ya.''
{57114}{57173}A second later,|he heard the body hit the floor.
{57176}{57299}He ran to the door and saw the kid run out|of the house. What's that mean to you?
{57301}{57387}l wonder how clearly he heard|the boy's voice through the ceiling.
{57389}{57487}He didn't. The window was open. So was|the one upstairs. lt was a hot night.
{57489}{57575}lt was another apartment.|lt's not easy to identify a shouting voice.
{57577}{57620}He identified it in court.
{57623}{57730}The lady across the street looked right in|the open window and saw the stabbing.
{57732}{57791}- lsn't that enough for you?|- No, it isn't.
{57794}{57884}Boy, how do you like this guy?|lt's like talkin' into a dead phone.
{57886}{57960}She said she saw it through|the windows of a moving el train.
{57962}{58046}There were six cars on the train.|She saw it through the last two.
{58049}{58145}She remembered insignificant details.|How can you argue with that?
{58147}{58275}Has anybody here any idea|how long it would take an el...
{58503}{58562}This isn't a game.
{58639}{58694}Did you see him?
{58697}{58775}The nerve! The absolute nerve!
{58778}{58870}- Forget it. lt's not important.|- This isn't a game?
{58872}{58954}- Who does he think he is?|- Forget it now.
{58956}{59083}Any idea how long it takes an el train|at medium speed to pass a given point?
{59085}{59130}- What has that to do with it?|- Guess.
{59132}{59189}- l wouldn't have any idea.|- What do you think?
{59191}{59304}- l don't know. Ten, twelve seconds?|- A pretty good guess. Anyone else?
{59306}{59370}- Sounds right to me.|- What's the guessing game for?
{59372}{59417}- What do you say?|- Ten seconds.
{59419}{59497}- All right. What are you getting at?|- This.
{59500}{59588}lt takes a six-car el train|ten seconds to pass a given point.
{59590}{59697}Say the given point is the open window|of the room where the killing took place.
{59699}{59771}You can reach out|and almost touch the el tracks, right?
{59773}{59865}Now let me ask you this. Has anyone|here ever lived near the el tracks?
{59868}{59983}l just finished painting an apartment that|overlooked an el line. lt took three days.
{59985}{60090}- What was it like? Noisy?|- Oh, brother! No matter. We were punchy.
{60092}{60157}l lived in an apartment|near the el line once.
{60159}{60233}When the window's open,|the train noise is almost unbearable.
{60236}{60324}- You can hardly hear yourself think.|- Will you get to the point?
{60327}{60448}l will. Now, let's take two pieces of|testimony and try to put them together.
{60451}{60552}First: the old man|in the apartment downstairs.
{60554}{60615}He says he heard the boy say|''l'm gonna kill you'',
{60617}{60681}and a split second later|heard a body hit the floor.
{60683}{60724}- One second later.|- Right.
{60727}{60792}Second: the woman across the street
{60794}{60891}swore positively she looked|out of the window and saw the killing
{60893}{60975}through the last two cars|of a passing el train - the last two cars.
{60977}{61043}- What are you givin' us here?|- Now, just a minute.
{61045}{61168}We've agreed that it takes ten seconds|for a train to pass a given point.
{61171}{61247}Since the woman saw the killing|through the last two cars,
{61250}{61380}we can assume that the body hit|the floor just as the train went by.
{61382}{61485}Therefore, the train had been|roaring by the old man's window
{61487}{61569}a full ten seconds|before the body hit the floor.
{61571}{61696}The old man - ''l'm gonna kill you'',|body hitting the floor a second later -
{61698}{61798}would have had to hear the boy's words|with the el roaring past his nose!
{61800}{61870}- lt's not possible he heard it.|- Of course he heard it.
{61872}{61952}- Do you think so?|- He said he yelled at the top of his voice.
{61954}{62032}He couldn't have identified the voice|with the el roaring by.
{62034}{62102}lt was a matter of seconds!|Nobody can be that accurate.
{62104}{62229}Testimony that could put a boy into the|electric chair should be that accurate.
{62266}{62371}- l don't think he could have heard it.|- Maybe he didn't, with all that el noise.
{62374}{62468}- What are you people talkin' about?|- lt stands to reason he couldn't have.
{62470}{62568}- Why lie? What's he got to gain?|- Attention, maybe.
{62570}{62695}You keep comin' in with bright sayings.|Send 'em to a paper! They pay $3 apiece!
{62697}{62764}What are you talkin' to him like that for?
{62766}{62850}A guy who talks like that to an old man|really oughta get stepped on.
{62853}{62925}You oughta have more respect, mister.
{62928}{63049}You say stuff like that to him again...|l'm gonna lay you out.
{63276}{63345}You go ahead. You say anything you like.
{63371}{63445}Why do you think the old man might lie?
{63448}{63545}lt was just that l looked at him|for a very long time.
{63547}{63625}The seam of his jacket was split,|under the shoulder.
{63627}{63732}Did you notice that?|l mean, to come into court like that.
{63792}{63872}He was a very old man in a torn jacket.
{63885}{63969}And he walked very slowly to the stand.
{63971}{64074}He was dragging his left leg|and trying to hide it,
{64076}{64137}because he was ashamed.
{64139}{64240}l think l know this man|better than anyone here.
{64242}{64310}This is a quiet, frightened,
{64312}{64371}insignificant old man who...
{64373}{64439}who has been nothing all his life.
{64441}{64558}Who has never had recognition|or his name in the newspapers.
{64561}{64662}Nobody knows him. Nobody quotes him.
{64664}{64754}Nobody seeks his advice after 75 years.
{64777}{64888}Gentlemen, that's a very sad thing -|to mean nothing.
{64890}{65005}A man like this needs to be quoted,|to be listened to.
{65009}{65107}To be quoted just once -|very important to him.
{65109}{65181}lt would be so hard for him|to recede into the background.
{65184}{65282}Wait a minute. Are you tellin' us he'd lie|just so he could be important once?
{65284}{65352}No. He wouldn't really lie.
{65354}{65434}But perhaps he made himself believe|he heard those words
{65437}{65492}and recognised the boy's face.
{65495}{65552}That's the most fantastic story ever.
{65555}{65649}How can you make up a thing like that?|What do you know about it?
{65860}{65944}- Does anybody want a cough drop?|- l'll take one.
{65946}{66032}l still don't see how anybody|can think he's not guilty.
{66034}{66134}There's something else l'd like|to talk about for a minute. Thanks.
{66136}{66233}We've proved the old man couldn't have|heard the boy say ''l'm gonna kill you.''
{66235}{66329}- You didn't prove it at all!|- Wait. Supposing he really did hear it?
{66331}{66423}This phrase, how many times have|all of us used it? Probably thousands.
{66426}{66545}''l could kill you for that.'' ''Junior, do that|again and l'll kill you.'' ''Rocky, kill him.''
{66548}{66673}- lt doesn't mean we'd really kill anybody.|- The phrase was: ''l'm gonna kill you.''
{66675}{66730}The kid yelled it at the top of his lungs.
{66732}{66818}Don't tell me he didn't mean it.|Anybody says it like that, they mean it!
{66821}{66866}Gee, l don't know.
{66869}{66959}l was arguing with the guy l work next to|at the bank a few weeks ago.
{66961}{67020}He called me an idiot, so l yelled at him.
{67022}{67089}This guy is trying to make you|believe what isn't so!
{67091}{67140}The kid said he'd kill him and he did!
{67143}{67254}Do you really think the boy'd shout it out|so the whole neighbourhood could hear?
{67257}{67374}- He's much too bright for that.|- Bright? He's a common, ignorant slob.
{67377}{67426}He don't even speak good English.
{67429}{67511}He doesn't even speak good English.
{67548}{67640}Mr Foreman, l'd like to|change my vote to not guilty.
{67656}{67707}- You what?|- You heard me.
{67709}{67791}- Are you sure?|- Yeah, l'm sure.
{67794}{67858}The vote is nine to three|in favour of guilty.
{67860}{67919}Well, if this isn't the livin' end!
{68019}{68105}What are you basin' it on?|Stories this guy made up?
{68107}{68205}You oughta write for one of those kooky|detective magazines, make a fortune.
{68207}{68295}For cryin' out loud, the kid's own lawyer|knew he didn't stand a chance.
{68297}{68381}Right from the beginning, his own|lawyer knew, and you could see it.
{68384}{68485}Boy, oh boy, l'm telling ya.|This guy here is really somethin'.
{68487}{68567}The kid had a lawyer, didn't he?|He presented his case, not you.
{68570}{68639}- How come you say so much?|- Lawyers aren't infallible.
{68641}{68713}- Baltimore, please.|- He was court-appointed.
{68716}{68769}- What's that supposed to mean?|- A lot.
{68771}{68849}He didn't want the case|or he resented being appointed.
{68851}{68958}lt's the kind of case that brings no money,|no glory, not much chance of winning.
{68960}{69034}That's not a very promising|situation for a young lawyer.
{69037}{69154}He'd really have to believe in his client to|put up a good case. Obviously he didn't.
{69157}{69206}Of course he didn't.
{69228}{69283}Who the heck could?
{69286}{69357}Except maybe some guy's mother|or somebody.
{69359}{69429}Oh, look.|Will you look at the time? Come on.
{69431}{69515}Pardon me. l have made some notes here,
{69518}{69600}and l would like, please,|to say something.
{69602}{69669}l have been listening very carefully and...
{69671}{69763}it seems to me that this man|has some very good points to make.
{69766}{69877}From what was presented at the trial,|the boy looks guilty, on the surface.
{69880}{69972}- But maybe if we go deeper...|- Come on, will ya?
{69974}{70027}There is a question l would like to ask.
{70030}{70112}Let us assume that the boy|really did commit the murder.
{70115}{70195}Now, this happened|at 10 minutes after 12.
{70198}{70259}Now, how was he caught by the police?
{70261}{70360}He came back home...|at three o'clock or so,
{70362}{70452}and he was captured by two detectives|in the hallway of his house.
{70455}{70566}Now, my question is:|if he really had killed his father,
{70568}{70650}why would he come back home|three hours later?
{70653}{70722}Wouldn't he be afraid of being caught?
{70724}{70822}He came home for his knife. lt's not nice|to leave knives in people's chests.
{70824}{70892}Yeah, especially relatives'.
{70894}{70957}l don't see anything funny about it.
{70959}{71035}The boy knew the knife|could be identified.
{71038}{71145}- He had to get it before the police did.|- lf he knew the knife could be identified,
{71148}{71211}why did he leave it there in the first place?
{71213}{71344}l think we can assume the boy ran out in a|state of panic, having just killed his father.
{71346}{71418}He calmed down and realised|he'd left his knife there.
{71420}{71490}This, then, depends|on your definition of panic.
{71492}{71611}He would have had to be calm enough to|wipe off any fingerprints left on the knife.
{71613}{71705}Now, where did this panic start|and where did it end?
{71708}{71775}You voted guilty. What side are you on?
{71777}{71853}l don't believe l have to be loyal|to one side or the other.
{71855}{71980}- l'm simply asking questions.|- This is just off the top of my head but...
{71983}{72084}lf l'd done the stabbing, l'd take a chance|and go back for the knife.
{72086}{72147}l'll bet he figured|nobody'd seen him running out
{72150}{72217}and the body wouldn't be discovered|till the next day.
{72219}{72320}After all, it was the middle of the night.|He figured it'd be found the next day.
{72322}{72371}Pardon. This is my whole point.
{72373}{72469}The woman across the street testified|that the moment after she saw the killing,
{72471}{72524}that is, a moment after the train went by,
{72527}{72603}she screamed, and then went|to telephone the police.
{72605}{72689}Now, the boy certainly|must have heard the scream.
{72692}{72770}So he knew that|somebody saw something.
{72772}{72841}l just don't think|that he would have gone back.
{72843}{72954}Two things. One: he may not have heard|the scream. Perhaps it wasn't very loud.
{72956}{73036}Two: if he did, he may not|have connected it with his own acts.
{73038}{73110}He lived in a neighbourhood|where screams were commonplace.
{73113}{73218}- There's your answer.|- Maybe. Maybe the boy did kill his father.
{73220}{73277}Didn't hear the scream,|did run out in a panic,
{73280}{73397}calmed down later and came back for the|knife, risking being caught by the police.
{73399}{73470}Maybe those things happened,|but maybe they didn't.
{73472}{73574}There's enough doubt to wonder if he was|there at all at the time of the killing.
{73576}{73658}What do you mean? Didn't the old man|see him running out of the house?
{73661}{73704}He's twisting the facts.
{73707}{73793}Did or didn't the old man see the kid|running out of the house at 12.10?
{73795}{73859}- Well, did or didn't he?|- He says he did.
{73861}{73920}Says he did? Boy, how do you like that?
{73922}{73996}- Witnesses can make mistakes.|- Sure, when you want them to!
{73999}{74064}- Or when he wants them to!|- Keep the yelling down.
{74066}{74181}Maybe we need a little yelling. These|guys keep going off every which way.
{74184}{74262}Did hear the scream, didn't hear it -|what difference does it make?
{74265}{74357}You're talking about little details|and forgetting the important stuff.
{74360}{74424}- l call for another vote.|- l'm talking here!
{74426}{74475}Another vote called for.
{74478}{74537}Now let's take our seats.
{74612}{74671}l never saw so much time|spent on nothin'.
{74673}{74728}lt only takes a second.
{74744}{74826}OK, l guess the fastest way is|to find out who's voting not guilty.
{74828}{74918}All those voting not guilty,|please raise your hands.
{74921}{75007}Still the same. One, two, three|not guilty. Nine guilty.
{75010}{75129}So now where are we? We can yakety-yak|till next Tuesday. Where's it getting us?
{75131}{75203}Pardon. l vote not guilty.
{75253}{75358}What are you talkin' about? l mean,|we're all goin' crazy in here or somethin'.
{75360}{75442}The kid is guilty.|Why don't you listen to the facts?
{75444}{75505}Tell them, will ya?|This is gettin' to be a joke.
{75508}{75588}The vote is eight to four in favour of guilty.
{75591}{75681}What is this?|Love Your Underprivileged Brother Week?
{75683}{75771}l want you to tell me why|you changed your vote. Give me reasons.
{75773}{75882}l don't have to defend my decision to you.|There is a reasonable doubt in my mind.
{75885}{75956}Reasonable doubt?|Nothing but words. Look at this.
{75958}{76077}The kid you just decided isn't guilty|was seen ramming this into his father!
{76080}{76197}- What about this, Mr Reasonable Doubt?|- That's not the knife, remember?
{76199}{76308}- Oh, brilliant!|- l'm tellin' you, this is the craziest.
{76311}{76430}l mean, what are we supposed to believe?|You're pullin' stories out of thin air.
{76432}{76524}A guy like this, if he's sittin' ringside|at the Dempsey-Firpo fight,
{76526}{76569}he'd be trying to tell you that...
{76583}{76638}Look. Now what about the old man?
{76640}{76728}Are we supposed to believe he didn't|see the kid tearin' down the steps
{76731}{76778}15 seconds after the killing?
{76781}{76844}He's just sayin' so to be important, right?
{76846}{76897}- What's the point of it all?|- Hold it.
{76899}{76954}The Baltimore rooter is heard from again.
{76956}{77040}- And pop-ups are fallin' for base hits.|- Hold on a second. Look.
{77043}{77127}- Did the old man say he ran to the door?|- What's the difference?
{77130}{77228}- He got there, didn't he?|- He said he ran. At least l think he did.
{77230}{77306}l don't remember, but l don't see|how he could have run.
{77309}{77395}He said he wentfrom his bedroom|to the front door. lsn't that enough?
{77397}{77456}- Where was the bedroom?|- Down the hall.
{77458}{77524}- Don't you remember that?|- No.
{77526}{77647}- l want to see a diagram of the apartment.|- Why don't we have him on trial again?
{77650}{77705}You're the only one|wants to see exhibits.
{77707}{77787}- l want to see this one, too.|- l'd like to stop wastin' time.
{77789}{77867}lf we're gonna wade through|that nonsense about the body...
{77869}{78000}No, but l'd like to know if an old man|who drags one foot cos he had a stroke
{78002}{78069}can get from his bedroom|to his front door in 15 seconds.
{78071}{78112}- He said 20.|- He said 15.
{78115}{78203}- 20. What are you tryin' to distort?|- He said 15.
{78205}{78281}How does he know how long|15 seconds is? You can't judge that.
{78283}{78344}He said 15. He was positive about it.
{78346}{78399}He was an old man! He was confused!
{78402}{78488}How could he be positive about anything?
{78647}{78746}l don't see what you're going to prove.|The man said he saw the boy running out.
{78748}{78826}Let's see if the details bear him out.|As the body hit the floor,
{78829}{78911}he said he heard footsteps upstairs,|running to the front door.
{78913}{78989}Heard the upstairs door open,|the footsteps start down.
{78992}{79130}He said he got to his own door in, at most,|15 seconds. lf the killer ran immediately...
{79132}{79193}- Maybe he didn't.|- The old man said he did.
{79196}{79276}You oughta be at|that hair-splitters' convention.
{79278}{79333}Why don't you stop|making smart remarks?
{79336}{79445}My friend, for your three dollars a day,|you have to listen to everything.
{79448}{79590}Here's the apartment. The old man's was|directly beneath and exactly the same.
{79592}{79717}Here are the el tracks, the bedroom, living|room, kitchen, bathroom, hall, stairs.
{79720}{79773}The old man was in this bedroom here.
{79776}{79856}He says he crossed to the door,|walked down the hall, opened the door
{79859}{79937}just in time to see the boy|running down the stairs. Am l right?
{79940}{79995}That's the story, for the 19th time.
{79998}{80082}- 15 seconds after the body hit the floor.|- Correct.
{80084}{80133}Now, let's see. lt was...
{80136}{80226}lt's 12 feet from the bed to the door.|The hall is 43 feet.
{80229}{80311}He would have had to walk 12 feet,|open the bedroom door,
{80314}{80400}walk 43 feet down and open|the front door, all in 15 seconds.
{80402}{80451}- Could he have done it?|- Sure.
{80454}{80526}He walks slowly. He needed help|into the witness chair.
{80528}{80656}- You make it sound like a long walk.|- For an old man who had a stroke, it is.
{80658}{80719}- What are you doin'?|- l'm gonna try it.
{80722}{80794}What do you mean?|Why didn't his lawyer bring it up?
{80796}{80895}- Maybe he just didn't think of it.|- Do you think he's an idiot? lt's obvious.
{80897}{80969}- Did you think of it?|- lt don't matter. He didn't bring it up
{80972}{81019}because he knew it'd hurt his case.
{81022}{81119}Or because it would have meant bullying|and badgering a helpless old man.
{81121}{81201}That doesn't sit well with a jury.|Most lawyers avoid it.
{81203}{81267}- What kind of a bum is he?|- That's what l'm asking.
{81269}{81341}Pass me that chair.|Those two chairs are the old man's bed.
{81344}{81411}l just paced off 12 feet.|This is the bedroom door.
{81413}{81482}That's crazy.|You can't re-create a thing like that.
{81484}{81615}The hall was 43 feet.|l'll pace from that wall and back again.
{81617}{81701}This is insane. What are you|wasting everybody's time for?
{81704}{81782}According to you, it'll only take|15 seconds. We can spare that.
{81864}{81913}Come on. Knock it off.
{81916}{81986}OK. OK, OK, killer.
{82005}{82054}Yeah.
{82098}{82201}Will you stand there and mark the front|door? lt was chain-locked, remember.
{82204}{82261}- Who's got a watch with a second hand?|- l have.
{82263}{82368}Stamp your foot. That'll be the body|falling. You can time me from there.
{82371}{82468}- What are we gonna do, play charades?|- What are we waiting for?
{82470}{82527}l wanna wait till|the second hand reaches 60.
{82530}{82579}Aw, come on!
{82730}{82833}Come on, speed it up.|He can walk twice as fast as that.
{82836}{82926}lf you want me to walk|faster than that, l will.
{83301}{83377}- Lock. Door. Stop.|- Right.
{83380}{83427}What's the time?
{83430}{83506}Exactly... 41 seconds.
{83509}{83616}This is what l think happened. The old|man heard the fight a few hours earlier.
{83619}{83683}When he's in bed,|he heard the body hit the floor,
{83685}{83769}heard the woman scream, got to|his front door as fast as he could,
{83772}{83833}heard somebody running|and assumed it was the boy.
{83836}{83910}- l think that's possible.|- Assumed?
{83946}{84017}Brother, l've seen all kinds|of dishonesty in my day,
{84019}{84090}but this little display takes the cake.
{84092}{84209}You all come in here with your hearts|bleedin' about slum kids and injustice.
{84212}{84315}You listen to some fairy tales. You start|getting through to these old ladies.
{84317}{84386}You're not getting through to me.|l've had enough.
{84388}{84489}What's the matter with you guys?|You all know he's guilty! He's got to burn!
{84491}{84573}- He'll slip through our fingers.|- Slip through our fingers?
{84575}{84669}- Are you his executioner?|- l'm one of 'em.
{84671}{84765}- Perhaps you'd like to pull the switch.|- For this kid, you bet l would.
{84768}{84860}l feel sorry for you. What it must|feel like to wanna pull the switch!
{84863}{84959}Ever since you walked in, you've acted|like a self-appointed public avenger.
{84961}{85058}You want to see this boy die because|you want it, not because of the facts.
{85060}{85121}- You're a sadist.|- You...
{85123}{85213}Let me go! l'll kill him! l'll kill him!
{85215}{85293}You don't really mean|you'll kill me, do you?
{85448}{85538}- Anything wrong? l heard some noise.|- No, everything's all right.
{85541}{85607}We're just... Friendly little argument.
{85609}{85734}We're through with that diagram.|You can take it if you want. Here you are.
{85892}{85951}What are you lookin' at?
{86438}{86507}- Somebody has to start off again.|- l beg pardon...
{86509}{86579}''l beg pardon.''|What are you so polite about?
{86581}{86704}For the same reason you're not.|lt's the way l was brought up.
{86729}{86823}This fighting... That's not|why we are here, to fight.
{86826}{86885}We have a responsibility.
{86913}{87018}This, l have always thought,|is a remarkable thing about democracy.
{87021}{87076}That we are...
{87110}{87159}What is the word?
{87162}{87265}Notified. That we are notified by mail|to come down to this place
{87268}{87443}to decide on the guilt or innocence of a|man we... we have never heard of before.
{87445}{87570}We have nothing to gain or lose|by... by our verdict.
{87572}{87673}This is one of the reasons|why we are strong.
{87675}{87769}We should not make it a... personal thing.
{87855}{87941}lf nobody else has an idea,|l might have a cutie here.
{87944}{88005}Let's throw it out|and see if the cat licks it up.
{88007}{88066}- The cat licks it up?|- Yeah. The boy...
{88177}{88307}Look how dark it's gettin' out there.|l bet we're gonna have a storm now.
{88332}{88410}Boy, oh boy. lt's really hot, huh?
{88428}{88553}- Pardon me, but... don't you ever sweat?|- No, l don't.
{88586}{88664}Listen. l... l was wonderin' if...
{88699}{88768}Maybe... maybe we should|take another vote.
{88770}{88897}Great. Maybe we can follow this one up|with a little dancing and refreshments!
{88899}{88973}- Mr Foreman?|- Well, that's OK with me.
{88976}{89066}Anyone doesn't wanna vote?|Hey, come on.
{89087}{89158}- Sorry.|- l think we ought to have an open ballot.
{89160}{89238}Call out our votes, you know?|Let's see who stands where.
{89241}{89325}Well, that sounds fair to me.|Anyone object?
{89369}{89453}OK. l'll call off your jury numbers. One?
{89456}{89534}Oh, that's me. l vote guilty. Two?
{89570}{89615}Not guilty.
{89618}{89659}Number three?
{89662}{89707}Guilty.
{89710}{89759}Number four?
{89789}{89828}Guilty.
{89831}{89868}Number five?
{89870}{89919}Not guilty.
{89922}{89973}Number six?
{89975}{90022}Not guilty.
{90024}{90065}Number seven?
{90067}{90110}Guilty.
{90112}{90157}Number eight?
{90159}{90208}Not guilty.
{90236}{90307}- Number nine?|- Not guilty.
{90309}{90380}- Number ten?|- Guilty.
{90401}{90448}Number eleven?
{90451}{90494}Not guilty.
{90497}{90546}Number twelve?
{90556}{90609}Number twelve!
{90612}{90667}Guilty.
{90794}{90858}The vote is now six to six.
{90860}{90930}And we go into extra innings here, eh?
{90964}{91089}Six to six! l'm telling you, some of you|people in here must be out of your minds.
{91092}{91130}A kid like that!
{91132}{91214}l don't think the kind of boy he is|has anything to do with it.
{91217}{91283}- Facts determine the case.|- Don't give me that!
{91285}{91361}l'm sick and tired of facts.|You can twist 'em any way you like.
{91364}{91442}That's exactly the point|this gentleman has been making.
{91445}{91512}You keep shouting|at the top of your lungs...
{91543}{91642}l'd like to be a few years younger.|That man gets on my...
{91723}{91782}- My, it's hot in here.|- Want a drink of water?
{91785}{91834}No, no. Thanks. Thanks.
{92065}{92172}- lt's gonna rain.|- Well, how'd you figure that out, killer?
{92197}{92306}- How come you changed your vote?|- lt just seemed there was room for doubt.
{92308}{92380}- You haven't got a leg to stand on.|- l don't feel that way.
{92383}{92459}- A lot of details never came out.|- Yeah, well, good luck.
{92462}{92600}Come on. You're like everybody else.|You think too much, you get mixed up.
{92602}{92698}- You know what l mean?|- l don't think you have any right to...
{92700}{92749}Loudmouth.
{94027}{94099}Look at that come down, will ya?
{94114}{94225}You know, this reminds me|of a storm we had last...
{94258}{94344}Was it November?|l don't know. Something.
{94347}{94439}lt was quite a storm we had.|lt was right in the middle of a game.
{94442}{94563}We were behind - seven to six. We'd just|started to move the ball, made a tackle.
{94565}{94680}lt was gonna cut right in, slash through,|slashed right in, cut right through...
{94682}{94731}And...
{94744}{94803}We had this kid - Slattery.
{94829}{94888}He was an ox. A real ox.
{94909}{94966}l wish l had another one just like him.
{94969}{95076}l forgot to tell you. l'm the assistant head|coach at Andrew J McCorkle High School.
{95078}{95131}That's out in Queens.
{95134}{95245}And anyway... we're starting|to move along real nice.
{95248}{95361}You know, their whole line is just...|just comin' apart.
{95363}{95449}And it starts to come down,|cats and dogs, just like this.
{95452}{95542}Just... whoosh! You know, right down.
{95545}{95627}Well, it was murder, you know?
{95630}{95755}l swear, l... l nearly bawled.|Just... We couldn't go nowhere.
{96188}{96274}Hey, what is it with this fan here?|How come...
{96510}{96580}Must have been|on the same switch with the lights.
{96582}{96654}Well, things are lookin' up here, huh?
{96671}{96720}Yeah.
{96822}{96871}Boy, that's better.
{97032}{97091}Hey! Two points.
{97208}{97276}You guys ever go to the Garden?
{97310}{97379}That's a damn stupid thing to do.
{97381}{97430}Oh, l'm sorry. l...
{97458}{97507}You know?
{97534}{97591}Pardon me.
{97593}{97708}Well, how do you like it? Even-steven.|Pretty surprising, isn't it?
{97711}{97760}Yes.
{97790}{97911}That... business before, when that tall guy,|whatshisname, was tryin' to bait me?
{97913}{98005}That doesn't prove anything.|l'm a... pretty excitable person.
{98007}{98097}Where does he come off|calling me a public avenger, a sadist?
{98100}{98188}Anyone in his right mind|would blow his stack.
{98190}{98243}He was just tryin' to bait me.
{98246}{98305}He did an excellent job.
{98355}{98406}l think we're going nowhere here.
{98408}{98469}l'm ready to walk into court|and declare a hung jury.
{98472}{98550}- There's no point in this thing going on.|- l go for that, too.
{98552}{98617}Let the kid take his chance|with 12 other guys.
{98619}{98697}The judge won't accept a hung jury.|We haven't been here long.
{98699}{98771}- Well, let's find out.|- l am not in favour of that.
{98774}{98858}This kid wouldn't stand a chance|with another jury, and you know it.
{98861}{98931}Come on, we're hung.|Nobody's gonna change his vote.
{98933}{99013}- Still no room for reasonable doubt?|- No.
{99016}{99141}Pardon. Maybe you don't fully understand|the term ''reasonable doubt''.
{99143}{99217}What do you mean, l don't understand?
{99220}{99300}How do you like this guy?|l'm tellin' you, they're all alike.
{99302}{99368}They come over here|and before they can take a breath,
{99370}{99435}they're telling us how to run the show.
{99437}{99511}- Boy, the arrogance of this guy!|- All right.
{99513}{99589}Let's stop the arguing|for about two minutes in here.
{99592}{99653}Now, who's got|something constructive to say?
{99655}{99737}l'd like to go over something,|if you gentlemen don't mind.
{99739}{99798}An important point|for the prosecution was
{99800}{99921}the fact that after the boy claimed he was|at the movies when the killing took place,
{99924}{100022}he couldn't remember the names|of the movies or who starred in them.
{100024}{100118}- This gentleman has made that point.|- That's correct.
{100121}{100228}lt's the only alibi the boy offered, and|he couldn't back it up with any details.
{100230}{100304}ln the boy's place,|do you think you could remember details
{100307}{100391}after an upsetting experience|such as being slapped by your father?
{100393}{100471}l think so, if there were|any special details to remember.
{100474}{100554}The boy couldn't remember the movies|because he wasn't there.
{100556}{100675}According to the police testimony,|the boy was questioned in the kitchen,
{100677}{100747}while the body of his father|was lying in the bedroom.
{100749}{100808}Do you think|you could remember details?
{100810}{100861}- l do.|- Under great emotional stress?
{100863}{100963}- Under great emotional stress.|- He remembered them correctly in court.
{100965}{101053}Yes. His lawyer took great pains|to bring that out.
{101055}{101152}He had three months to the day of the trial|in which to memorise them.
{101154}{101263}lt's not difficult for a lawyer to find out|what played on a particular night.
{101265}{101351}l'll take the testimony|from right after the murder,
{101354}{101457}when he couldn't remember a thing about|the movies, great emotional stress or not.
{101466}{101544}- l'd like to ask you a personal question.|- Go ahead.
{101547}{101623}- Where were you last night?|- l was home all night.
{101626}{101685}- How about the night before that?|- What is this?
{101688}{101780}lt's all right. l left the office at 8.30|and went straight home and to bed.
{101783}{101886}- And the night before that?|- That was... Tuesday night.
{101888}{101959}- The bridge tournament. l played bridge.|- Monday night?
{101961}{102043}When you get to|New Year's Eve 1954, let me know.
{102088}{102240}Monday night? Monday night...|my wife and l went to the movies.
{102243}{102314}- What did you see?|- The Scarlet Circle. A whodunit.
{102316}{102385}- What was the second feature?|- The...
{102429}{102494}l'll tell you in a minute. The...
{102496}{102545}Remarkable Mrs...
{102579}{102628}Something.
{102658}{102719}Mrs Bainbridge.|The Remarkable Mrs Bainbridge.
{102722}{102812}l saw that. lt's called|The Amazing Mrs Bainbridge.
{102814}{102875}Yes. The Amazing Mrs Bainbridge.
{102878}{102939}Who was in|The Amazing Mrs Bainbridge?
{102941}{103033}Barbara... Long, l think it was.
{103035}{103092}A dark, very pretty girl.
{103114}{103194}- Ling or... Long. Something like that.|- Who else?
{103197}{103248}l'd never heard of them before.
{103251}{103362}lt was a very inexpensive|second feature, with unknown...
{103364}{103464}And you weren't under|an emotional stress, were you?
{103505}{103554}No.
{103557}{103606}l wasn't.
{103644}{103716}- l think the point is made.|- Big point.
{103756}{103850}You can talk till your tongue is|draggin' on the floor. The boy is guilty.
{103852}{103905}Know what l mean, my friend?
{103908}{104008}- You got those cough drops?|- They're all gone, my friend.
{104039}{104136}Oh, boy. Look at that rain.|There goes your ball game.
{104151}{104206}lt's only a shower.
{104209}{104274}Besides, they got the infield covered.
{104276}{104360}Say, could l see that knife|a second, please?
{104403}{104514}Well, we're still tied up six to six.|Who's got a suggestion?
{104516}{104616}- lt's 5 after 6. Let's get some dinner.|- Why don't we wait till 7 o'clock?
{104618}{104638}OK with me.
{104676}{104762}There's something l'd like to say.|lt's been bothering me a little,
{104764}{104819}and as long as we're stuck...
{104821}{104913}There was this whole business about|the stab wound and how it was made.
{104916}{105000}- The downward angle of it, you know?|- Don't start with that again.
{105003}{105097}- They've been over it and over it.|- l know, but l don't go along with it.
{105099}{105197}The boy was five feet seven inches tall.|His father was six two.
{105199}{105254}That's a difference of seven inches.
{105257}{105360}lt's very awkward to stab down into the|chest of someone over half a foot taller.
{105362}{105421}Give me that.
{105423}{105513}l'll give you a demonstration.|Somebody get up.
{105683}{105740}Watch this - l don't wanna|have to do it again.
{105742}{105811}l'll make myself about|six or seven inches shorter.
{105813}{105901}- That's about right. Maybe a little more.|- OK, a little more.
{106177}{106236}Now... nobody's hurt.
{106258}{106317}- Right?|- Right. Nobody hurt.
{106413}{106532}Now, this is the way l'd stab a man|who was... taller than l was.
{106535}{106594}Look at the angle. Down and in.
{106597}{106687}And this is the way it was done.|Now tell me l'm wrong.
{106754}{106832}- Down and in. There's no argument.|- Hold on a minute.
{106834}{106883}Will you give me that?
{106901}{106950}Boy, l hate these things.
{106953}{107029}- Did you ever see a knife fight?|- No.
{107031}{107103}Anybody here ever see a knife fight?
{107106}{107229}Well, l have. You know, on my back stoop,|the lot across the street, back yard.
{107231}{107288}Switchblades came|with the neighbourhood.
{107290}{107364}Funny l never thought of it before.|l guess you try to forget.
{107366}{107489}- How do you use a switchblade?|- Well, you'd never use it like this.
{107492}{107574}See, you'd lose too much time|switching hands.
{107591}{107650}Here's how. Underhand.
{107714}{107790}Anyone who's ever used one|wouldn't handle it any other way.
{107792}{107849}- Are you sure?|- l'm sure.
{107852}{107963}- lt's why they're made to open like that.|- The boy was pretty handy with a knife?
{107966}{108040}You think he could have made|the wound that killed his father?
{108042}{108139}No. Not with the experience he got|all his life handling these things.
{108141}{108217}- l feel he'd have gone for him underhand.|- How do you know?
{108219}{108313}- Were you there when he was killed?|- No. Neither was anybody else.
{108316}{108394}What are you giving us this|mumbo jumbo for? l don't believe it.
{108396}{108474}l don't think you can tell|what wound he might have made
{108476}{108535}simply because he knew|how to handle a knife.
{108537}{108611}- What do you think?|- l don't know.
{108614}{108696}- What do you mean, you don't know?|- l don't know.
{108796}{108865}- How about you?|- l don't know about the rest of 'em,
{108867}{108965}but l'm gettin' tired of this|yakety-yakkin'. lt's gettin' us nowhere.
{108967}{109084}So l guess l'll have to break it up.|l'm changin' my vote to not guilty.
{109086}{109158}- You're what?|- You heard me. l've had enough.
{109161}{109290}- You've had enough? That's no answer.|- Listen, you just take care of yourself.
{109292}{109351}- You know?|- He's right.
{109360}{109419}That's not an answer.
{109421}{109491}What kind of a man are you?
{109493}{109569}You have sat here and voted|guilty with everyone else
{109571}{109674}because there are some baseball tickets|burning a hole in your pocket.
{109676}{109793}Now you have changed your vote because|you say you're sick of all the talking?
{109796}{109886}- Now, listen, buddy...|- Who tells you that you have the right
{109889}{109961}to play like this with a man's life?|Don't you care...
{109963}{110041}Now, wait a minute.|You can't talk like that to me.
{110044}{110151}l can talk like that to you.|lf you want to vote not guilty,
{110154}{110261}do it because you are convinced he is not|guilty, not because you've had enough.
{110263}{110330}And if you think he is guilty,|then vote that way.
{110332}{110402}Or don't you have the guts|to do what you think is right?
{110404}{110475}- Now, listen...|- Guilty or not guilty?
{110477}{110563}- l told you. Not guilty.|- Why?
{110609}{110722}- Look, l don't have to...|- You do have to. Say it. Why?
{110725}{110780}l... l don't think he's guilty.
{111008}{111109}- l want another vote.|- OK, that's another vote called for.
{111111}{111183}l guess the quickest way|is a show of hands. Anyone object?
{111186}{111254}OK, all those voting not guilty,|raise your hands.
{111263}{111314}One, two, three,
{111324}{111398}four, five, six, seven...
{111462}{111511}eight.
{111629}{111678}Nine.
{111719}{111797}All those voting guilty, raise your hands.
{111799}{111854}One, two, three.
{111856}{111938}Well, the vote's nine to three|in favour of acquittal.
{111943}{111986}l don't understand you people!
{111988}{112084}All these picky little points you keep|bringing up, they don't mean nothing!
{112086}{112127}You saw this kid just like l did.
{112129}{112213}Don't tell me you believe that|phoney story about losing the knife
{112215}{112264}and about being at the movies.
{112267}{112339}Look, you know how these people lie.|lt's born in them.
{112342}{112439}What the heck? l don't have to tell you.|They don't know what the truth is!
{112441}{112527}And they don't need any real big reason|to kill someone, either.
{112530}{112647}No, sir. They get drunk.|They're real big drinkers, all of 'em.
{112650}{112724}You know that. And bang!|Someone's lying in the gutter.
{112726}{112800}Nobody's blaming 'em.|That's the way they are by nature.
{112802}{112886}You know what l mean? Violent.|Where are you going?
{112888}{112988}Human life don't mean|as much to them as it does to us.
{112990}{113053}They're lushing it up|and fighting all the time,
{113055}{113143}and if somebody gets killed,|somebody gets killed! They don't care!
{113145}{113242}Sure, there's some good things about 'em,|too. l'm the first one to say that.
{113244}{113330}l've known a couple who were OK,|but that's the exception.
{113332}{113420}Most of 'em, it's like they have|no feelings! They can do anything!
{113422}{113471}What's going on here?
{113489}{113586}l'm trying to tell you.|You're making a big mistake, you people.
{113588}{113678}This kid is a liar. l know it.|l know all about them.
{113701}{113750}Listen to me. They're no good.
{113753}{113818}There's not a one of 'em who's any good.
{113860}{113919}l mean, what's happening in here?
{113922}{113983}l speak my piece, and you...
{114003}{114052}Listen to me.
{114071}{114130}l... We're... we're...
{114133}{114242}This kid on trial here. His type.|Well, don't you know about them?
{114263}{114322}There's a... There's a danger here.
{114348}{114399}These people are dangerous.
{114402}{114457}They're... wild.
{114479}{114538}Listen to me. Listen to me.
{114553}{114649}l have. Now, sit down|and don't open your mouth again.
{114743}{114811}Some of the time... l tell you.
{115684}{115816}lt's always difficult to keep personal|prejudice out of a thing like this.
{115818}{115950}Wherever you run into it,|prejudice always obscures the truth.
{115952}{116009}l don't really know what the truth is.
{116011}{116112}l don't suppose anybody|will ever really know.
{116114}{116204}Nine of us now seem to feel|that the defendant is innocent.
{116207}{116330}But we're just gambling on|probabilities. We may be wrong.
{116332}{116474}We may be trying to let a guilty man|go free. l don't know. Nobody really can.
{116477}{116532}But we have a reasonable doubt.
{116534}{116624}And that's something|that's very valuable in our system.
{116626}{116737}No jury can declare a man guilty|unless it's sure.
{116764}{116893}We nine can't understand|how you three are still so sure.
{116917}{116976}- Maybe you can tell us.|- l'll try.
{116997}{117085}You've made some excellent points,|but l still believe the boy is guilty.
{117087}{117194}l have two reasons. One: the evidence|given by the woman across the street,
{117196}{117264}who actually saw the murder committed.
{117266}{117331}That's the most important testimony.
{117333}{117396}And two: the fact that|she described the stabbing
{117398}{117472}by saying she saw the boy|raise his arm over his head
{117475}{117545}and stab down into the father's chest.
{117547}{117643}- She saw him do it, the wrong way.|- That's absolutely right.
{117654}{117711}Let's talk about this woman for a moment.
{117714}{117790}She said she went to bed|about eleven o'clock that night.
{117792}{117872}Her bed was next to the window,|and she could look out
{117874}{117973}and see directly into|the boy's room across the street.
{117975}{118036}She tossed and turned for over an hour.
{118038}{118138}Finally, she turned toward the window|at about 10 minutes after 12,
{118140}{118268}and as she looked out, she saw the killing|through the windows of a passing el train.
{118270}{118327}She said the lights went out|after the killing,
{118330}{118468}but that she got a good look at the boy|in the act of stabbing his father.
{118471}{118580}As far as l can see it,|this is unshakeable testimony.
{118582}{118666}- Well, that's the whole case.|- What do you think?
{118779}{118828}How about you?
{118860}{119010}l don't know. So much evidence to sift.|This is a pretty complicated business.
{119013}{119107}Frankly, l don't see how|you can vote for acquittal.
{119110}{119210}- lt's not so easy to arrange the evidence.|- Throw out all the other evidence!
{119212}{119298}The woman saw him do it!|What else do you want?
{119301}{119352}- Well, maybe...|- Let's vote on it.
{119355}{119447}OK, there's another vote called for.|Anyone object?
{119450}{119503}All right. l'm changing my vote.
{119506}{119582}- He's guilty.|- Anybody else? The vote is eight to four.
{119585}{119669}Why is this such a personal triumph|for you, this one vote?
{119672}{119754}OK. l say we're a hung jury.|l say we take it in to the judge.
{119757}{119827}How about it? l wanna hear arguments.
{119829}{119919}You, you're the leader of the cause.|What about it?
{119940}{120030}- Let's go over it again.|- We've been over it again.
{120033}{120148}The boy in the grey flannel suit is|bouncin' back and forth like a tennis ball.
{120150}{120281}There's no point in getting nasty.|You keep trying to turn this into a contest.
{120296}{120322}OK.
{120324}{120398}Maybe we can talk about|setting some kind of time limit.
{120400}{120470}Yeah. Once around for the deal, huh?
{120472}{120612}lt's... a quarter after six. Someone|before mentioned seven o'clock.
{120614}{120750}That's a point at which we might begin to|discuss whether we're a hung jury or not.
{120753}{120870}- Don't you feel well?|- l feel perfectly well, thank you.
{120872}{120943}l was saying seven o'clock|would be a reasonable time...
{120945}{121047}The reason l asked that was because|you were rubbing your nose like...
{121049}{121113}Oh, l'm sorry for interrupting.
{121115}{121197}But you made a gesture|that reminded me of something.
{121199}{121316}- l'm trying to settle something here.|- Well, l think this is important.
{121322}{121427}Thank you. Now, then.|l'm sure you'll pardon me for this,
{121429}{121501}but l was wondering why|you rub your nose like that.
{121504}{121534}Come on, will you?
{121537}{121644}At this point l happen to be talking|to the gentleman sitting next to you.
{121646}{121728}Now, why were you|rubbing your nose like that?
{121730}{121824}lf it's any of your business, l was|rubbing it because it bothers me a little.
{121826}{121922}Oh, l'm sorry. ls it...|ls it because of your eyeglasses?
{121924}{122008}lt is. Now could we get on|to something else?
{122011}{122120}Your eyeglasses made those two deep|impressions on the sides of your nose.
{122122}{122208}l hadn't noticed that before.|That must be annoying.
{122210}{122259}lt is very annoying.
{122262}{122392}l wouldn't know about that.|l've never worn eyeglasses. 20l20.
{122394}{122495}Listen, will you come on already|with the optometrist bit?
{122497}{122585}The woman who testified|that she saw the killing
{122587}{122688}had those same marks|on the sides of her nose.
{122690}{122739}Holy smoke! He's right.
{122742}{122878}Please. Just give me a minute...|and l'll be finished.
{122881}{122952}l don't know if anyone else|noticed that about her.
{122954}{123120}l didn't think of it then, but l've been|going over her face... in my mind.
{123122}{123224}She had those same marks.|She kept rubbing them in court.
{123234}{123316}He's right. She did do that a lot.
{123318}{123408}This woman was about 45 years old.
{123433}{123529}She was making|a tremendous effort to look 375.
{123531}{123664}For her first public appearance.|Heavy make-up. Dyed hair.
{123666}{123758}Brand-new clothes that should have|been worn by a younger woman.
{123760}{123902}No glasses. Well, women do that.|See if you can get a mental picture of her.
{123905}{123989}What do you mean, no glasses? How do|you know whether she wore glasses?
{123992}{124072}- Just cos she was rubbin' her nose?|- She had those marks. l saw 'em.
{124075}{124155}- So? What do you think that means?|- l'm sick of your yellin'...
{124158}{124194}Come on. Forget it.
{124196}{124305}Hey, listen. Listen, he's right. l saw|them too. l was the closest one to her.
{124308}{124382}She had these things|on the side of her nose.
{124389}{124430}What point are you makin'?
{124432}{124518}She had dyed hair, marks on her nose.|What does that mean?
{124521}{124630}Could those marks be made|by anything other than eyeglasses?
{124713}{124764}No. They couldn't.
{124766}{124825}l didn't see any marks!
{124861}{124960}l did. Strange,|but l didn't think about it before.
{124962}{125015}Why didn't the lawyer say something?
{125018}{125089}There are twelve people in here|concentrating on this case.
{125091}{125179}- Eleven of us didn't think of it either.|- What about the district attorney?
{125182}{125266}You think he'd pull that?|Have her testify without her glasses?
{125269}{125371}Ever see a woman who didn't want to|wear them because they spoil her looks?
{125373}{125488}OK. She had marks on her nose.|l'm givin' you that.
{125490}{125570}From glasses, right? She didn't|wanna wear 'em out of the house
{125572}{125644}so people'd think she's gorgeous.
{125647}{125750}But when she saw this kid killin'|his father, she was in the house alone.
{125753}{125802}That's all.
{125806}{125865}Do you wear glasses when you go to bed?
{125867}{125916}No. l don't.
{125942}{125991}No one wears eyeglasses to bed.
{125993}{126102}lt's logical to assume|that she wasn't wearing them in bed.
{126105}{126164}- How do you know?|- l don't know. l'm guessing.
{126166}{126277}l'm also guessing that she didn't put them|on when she looked out of the window.
{126280}{126354}She testified the killing|took place just as she looked out.
{126357}{126429}The lights went off.|She didn't have time to put them on.
{126431}{126523}Here's another guess. She honestly|thought she saw the boy kill his father.
{126526}{126610}- l say she only saw a blur.|- How do you know what she saw?
{126612}{126696}How does he know all that? How|do you know what glasses she wore?
{126698}{126792}Maybe they were sunglasses! Maybe|she was far-sighted! What do you know?
{126794}{126866}l only know the woman's eyesight|is in question now.
{126868}{127012}She had to be able to identify a person|60 feet away, at night, without glasses.
{127015}{127087}You can't send someone off|to die on evidence like that.
{127089}{127125}Aw, don't give me that.
{127127}{127199}- Might she not have made a mistake?|- No.
{127204}{127276}- lt's not possible?|- No, it's not possible.
{127355}{127404}ls it possible?
{127426}{127475}Not guilty.
{127565}{127628}Do you think he's guilty?
{127630}{127685}l think he's guilty.
{127745}{127794}Do you?
{127849}{127885}No.
{127887}{127959}l'm convinced. Not guilty.
{127962}{128056}- What's the matter with you?|- l have a reasonable doubt now.
{128059}{128133}- lt's eleven to one.|- What about all the other evidence?
{128135}{128221}What about all that stuff? The...|The knife? The whole business?
{128223}{128321}Well, you said we could|throw out all the other evidence.
{128431}{128490}Well, what do we do now?
{128559}{128604}You're alone.
{128606}{128709}l don't care whether l'm alone or not.|lt's my right.
{128765}{128812}lt's your right.
{129040}{129111}Well, what do you want? l say he's guilty.
{129131}{129232}- We want to hear your arguments.|- l gave you my arguments.
{129242}{129332}We're not convinced.|We want to hear them again.
{129359}{129426}We have as much time as it takes.
{129545}{129697}Everything - every single thing that took|place in that courtroom says he's guilty.
{129699}{129773}What do you think?|l'm an idiot or somethin'?
{129799}{129935}Take that stuff about the old man,|who lived there and heard everything!
{129966}{130054}Or this business about the knife.|They found another one exactly like it?
{130056}{130140}The old man saw him!|Right there, on the stairs.
{130142}{130228}What's the difference|how many seconds it was?
{130241}{130391}Every single thing. The knife|fallin' through a hole in his pocket.
{130393}{130481}You can't prove he didn't get to the door!
{130483}{130596}Sure, you can take all the time, hobble|around the room, but you can't prove it!
{130658}{130730}And what about this business of the el?|And the movies?
{130733}{130811}There's a phoney deal if l ever heard one.
{130814}{130910}l'll bet you $5,000|l'd remember the movies l saw.
{130912}{131060}l'm tellin' you, everything that's gone on|has been twisted and turned!
{131063}{131151}This business with the glasses?|How do you know she didn't have 'em on?
{131154}{131234}This woman testified in open court!
{131253}{131345}And what about|hearin' the kid yell? Huh?
{131348}{131448}l'm tellin' ya, l've got all the facts here.
{131458}{131507}Here...
{131557}{131637}Well, that's it. That's the whole case.
{131792}{131841}Well?
{131884}{131933}Say something!
{132054}{132134}You lousy bunch of bleedin' hearts.
{132154}{132279}You're not gonna intimidate me.|l'm entitled to my opinion.
{132341}{132431}Rotten kids... You work your life out!
{132716}{132765}No...
{132851}{132900}Not guilty.
{132978}{133027}Not guilty.
{133398}{133447}We're ready now.
{136155}{136204}Hey!
{136306}{136378}- What's your name?|- Davis.
{136380}{136429}My name's McCardle.
{136485}{136550}- Well, so long.|- So long.
